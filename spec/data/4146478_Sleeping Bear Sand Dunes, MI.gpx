      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Are you ready to climb the sand dunes? You can but only in
designated areas. This cache will take you to that location. First
we are going to learn how they got here, when they got here, how
long they will be around and why you are any allowed in climbing
areas.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The dunes before you began with the Ice Age. About ten million
years ago the earth began to cool which lead to the Ice Age which
lead to the great Ice Age of the past two million years. The
continental glaciers alternately advanced and retreated that
produced glacial and interglacial times. The glaciers covered
Michigan and large parts of Ohio, Indiana and Illinois. It has only
been 11,800 years that the last glacier retreated from this area.
The movement of the glaciers carried rock stone and sand along with
it. They also caused the lake water to rise and fall. With this
combination the Michigan shoreline base was created. The deposits
caused land to jutted out into the lake creating highlands. The
sand dunes themselves are estimated to have been here about 2
thousand years.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The highland here is the Sleeping Bear Plateau and is the base that
supports these dunes. The dunes here are classified as "perched
dunes". The perched dunes of the Sleeping Bear Plateau are actually
a relatively thin blanket of wind blown sand resting on a thick
deposit of sandy glacial debris. When the wind reworks the upper
layers of the glacial sediment, sand is deposited into the dunes
while the coarser material remains behind as lag gravel. Silt and
clay-sized particles are so light that they remain suspension and
travel a long distance before settling. The wind is an effective
sorting agent and dune sand shows little in variation in size. Ice,
wind and water move the sand here so it is continually changing the
land of the surrounding area.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The Sleeping Bear Dunes are very active and have been advancing
from there beginning. Currently the dunes have been moving rather
quickly. 100 years ago the dunes were about 235 feet at the knob on
the tall dune. The area that we are bring you to is currently
moving at a rate of about 4 foot per year. There have also been a
couple of large masses of the dune fall into Lake Michigan over the
past century. So the question still remains will the dunes continue
to erode, how long will they last? No one can say for sure because
of the movement it may just move farther along the shore.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Your job here is to help log the movement of these dunes. This is
going to be some work because it is time for you to climb the
dunes.&lt;br&gt;
1. Take an altitude reading from the flat ground at the bottom of
the dunes. This will let us know the sand migration into the
lowlands.&lt;br&gt;
2. Climb to N44 53.255 W86 03.033. Take an altimeter reading there.
This reading will show us how much of the dunes are migrating from
the climbing area.&lt;br&gt;
3. You will need to visit the beach on Lake Michigan at the dunes.
This can be done one of 2 ways.&lt;br&gt;
Option 1. If you are up for the walk it is worth taking the time to
cross the dunes. It usually takes us about 2.5 hours to make the
round trip across the dunes. Once you make it to the lake take an
altimeter reading here. Post a picture of yourself on the beach so
that we can see both the lake and the dunes in the background.&lt;br&gt;
Option 2. You will have to drive to the beach at Empire. You will
find parking at N44 48.825 W086 04.050. Once there you will need an
altimeter reading. Here you will also need to past a picture of
yourself with the replica lighthouse in the back ground.&lt;br&gt;
E-mail me with the results of the first test. Then find the
difference between #2 and #3 altimeter reading, include this result
in the e-mail. Post your photos.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
You may not want to attempt this cache in the off season. Though a
beautiful time to be here the snow will get a sand covering. This
can be deceiving and can be a deep plunge.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
You will need to purchase a park pass to enter the parking area.
You will have to stop at the visitor center to purchase your pass.
The Sleeping Bear Dunes National Shoreline visitor center can be
found at N44 48.685 W086 03.375. For more information on fees and
schedule go to www.nps.gov/slbe.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

What fun and a true walk down memory lane.  My family used to visit Sleeping Bear when I was a kid, back in the late 50s.  A highlight of our summer vacation was always the dune climb, although I don’t recall if it was named that at the time this was a State Park.  Except for the NPS parking lot, it seems just as I remembered it some 50 years ago.  Gecko Grandma and I were here on a week-long visit, our first return since 1960.  Driving down in the morning from our lodging in Leland two days after Labor Day meant we initially had the dunes nearly to ourselves.  And a gorgeous day it was.  Sunny, mild breeze, temperature in the upper 70s.

I took a GPS elevation reading at the first waypoint then hoofed it up the hill while GG, now 78 years old, took a less challenging stroll along the nature trail.  I told her I would be back in 45 minutes so I hoofed it up the hill and jogged to the second waypoint and then beyond to a higher point (25 feet higher than the reference waypoint) where I had a good view of Lake Michigan and South Manitou Island.  Then I ran back to meet her at the car, arriving at almost precisely the same time.

We drove the Pierce Stocking Scenic Drive stopping at each numbered point of interest and walking over to the three overlooks.  We stopped for a snack at the North Bar Picnic Area.  After exiting the drive, GG and I headed over to the Visitor Center to see the interpretive displays then proceeded to Empire Beach to get the final readings from the optional third site.

Thanks for an informative and very scenic multistage Earthcache.

The geocache is on a trail built in 1993 to provide an accessible trail for all persons to natural areas in the park. Volunteers from the Grand Traverse Audubon Club gave over 900 hours of labor building the trail, under park supervision. Wheelchairs and cassette tapes for the trail are available at the visitor center in Empire. The trail goes through several different habitats, with interpretive signs. This is a good geocache to take the kids on. 

&lt;p&gt;Use your National Parks Pass or Golden Pass (Age, Eagle or Access) for park entry!  If you do not have that, a $10.00 Sleeping Bear Dunes' Park Pass provides unlimited use of the park for all of the occupants of a non-commercial vehicle for up to seven days.

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">The cache container is a peanut butter jar big enough for a log, pencil and small trade items.  It is located across M-109 from Maple Grove Cemetery.  It can be found even if there is deep snow.  For parking, find a wide spot on the road shoulder.  (Note - this cache is not on National Lakeshore property.)</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This cache is named for the classic 1948 movie directed by John Huston, starring Humphrey Bogart as Fred C. Dobbs, Walter Huston as Howard, Tim Holt as Bob Curtin, Barton MacLane as Pat McCormick, Bruce Bennett as James Cody, and Alfonso Bedoya as Gold Hat the bandit.
 
Howard: Now here's where we're bound for, hereabouts. Don't show properly whether there's mountains, swamp, or desert. That shows the makers of the map themselves don't know for sure. Once on the ground, all we gotta do is open our eyes and look around. 

Fred C. Dobbs: This is the country where the nuggets of gold are just crying out for you to take them out of the ground and make 'em shine in coins on the fingers and necks of swell dames. 

Howard: Aah, gold's a devilish sort of thing, anyway.  I know what gold does to men's souls.  Ah, as long as there's no find, the noble brotherhood will last but when the piles of gold begin to grow... that's when the trouble starts. 

Howard: A thousand men, say, go searchin' for gold. After six months, one of them's lucky: one out of a thousand. His find represents not only his own labor, but that of nine hundred and ninety-nine others to boot. That's six thousand months, five hundred years, scramblin' over a mountain, goin' hungry and thirsty. An ounce of gold, mister, is worth what it is because of the human labor that went into the findin' and the gettin' of it.. Gold itself ain't good for nothing except making jewelry with and gold teeth. 

Fred C. Dobbs: I think I'll go to sleep and dream about piles of gold getting bigger and bigger and bigger.

Gold Hat: Badges? We ain't got no badges. We don't need no badges. I don't have to show you any stinking badges.</groundspeak:long_description>

is a Multi-Cache.&lt;/b&gt; The first stage is a camoed film canister
located in a cedar tree at the beach which contains the coordinates
to the cache, approximately 2 1/2 miles out of town.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Village of Empire is named after a ship although there is some
controversy as to which one. The side wheel steamer &lt;b&gt;Empire&lt;/b&gt;
ran aground here in 1849, and the schooner &lt;b&gt;Empire&lt;/b&gt; was
trapped in the ice here for the winter of 1865. Today Empire is the
site of the headquarters and Visitor Center of the Sleeping Bear
Dunes National Lakeshore. (Not to mention The Friendly Tavern) 
&lt;p&gt;The Michigan Shore-To-Shore Trail begins at Lake Michigan in
Empire and ends more than 200 miles east at Lake Huron near
Oscoda.The trail was created and is maintained by the Michigan
Trail Riders Association in cooperation with the DNR. Closed to
motorized traffic, it passes through meadows and forests where
possible and uses roadside shoulders where necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find and copy the number codes contained in all of the
containers in this 14 cache series. They will allow you to find and
unlock the Hopkins Creek cache and complete the Geochallenge.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Commemorative high quality S2S T shirts have been created and will
be presented to ten members of the first teams to complete the
challenge. To be eligible, the members receiving shirts must
&lt;b&gt;all&lt;/b&gt; have participated in the quest and must &lt;b&gt;all&lt;/b&gt; be
present and listed when logging finds. After the complimentary T
shirts have been awarded, shirts will be available for purchase by
additional challenge finishers for their cost plus shipping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first stage is a micro container in a park on the shore of
Lake Michigan which contains the coordinates to a one quart clear
plastic container hidden along the trail approximately two and a
half miles to the east.&lt;/p&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I've been to this park before when I was waymarking http://www.waymarking.com/wm/search.aspx?f=1&amp;lat=44.8169&amp;lon=-86.0793&amp;t=6  There were quite a few visitors today, but not as many as the usual summer day.  I actually found a place to park this time!  The first stage was tricky.  A real challenge to look nonchalant.  But I found it in short order.  The final was a little more difficult, but not as difficult as I made it if you know what I mean.  This was #13 of 13!  On to the final!  But wait, I'm one letter short!  Luckily it's one of the combination letters. DRIVE ON!

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This is a Historic landmark.     The Empire Lumber Company operated from 1887 to ???, dominating this once booming lumber town. It was  capable of producing up to 20 million feet of lumber a year. I expanded to one of the largest and best equipped hardwood mills in the area. Destroyed by fire in 1906,and was quickly rebuilt.  With most of the nearby virgin timber gone, the mill was not replaced. Empire is now a picturesque village near the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore. What year was the second fire? E mail me with your answer.

They're excited about meeting the cachers who stop by.  They will even offer some help if you need it.  You can park in the end of the driveway  or across the street on the grass.

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">The coordinates above will take you to a plaque at the ghost town of Aral in the Sleeping Bear National Lakeshore.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
Plan to poke around because it is located on one of the finest and least used beaches in northern Michigan.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
Due to NPS restrictions on caches, this is an off set cache.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
Bring a calculator to solve for the cache coordinates.&lt;BR&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Town Name:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Aral&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Population:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Less than 10&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Reason For Becoming a Lost Town:&lt;/STRONG&gt; The timber ran out, the mill closed, then the stores and folks went elsewhere looking for work.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Town History:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Aral was named for the inland sea in Russia. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The plaque at the coordinates gives some of the details of the history of the town but strangely, leaves out what I believe to be the two most interesting. On the afternoon of August 10th 1899, two Benzie County deputies, Neil A. Marshall and Dr. Frank Thurber were sent here to place a lien for unpaid taxes on the logs stacked at the mill. Hearing of their intent, the manager of the mill, Charles Wright promised that if anyone interfered with his operation, he "would drop them". Armed with a rifle and pistol, he met the men on the road that runs south across the creek just east of the plaque. Here a struggle ensued and both deputies were murdered. The mill continued to operate and Wright and his men continued as if nothing had happened. The bodies were left where they fell although at some point in the afternoon, some one placed an umbrella over them to shade them from the sun.Word of the killings spread through the community and anti-Wright feelings were building. Wright then shut the mill down, paid the workmen their wages and disappeared into the woods. A telegram was sent to Benzonia informing the sheriff of the killings. He organized a posse of about 20 men who traveled by buggy from Benzonia to Frankfort and then by steamer to Aral, arriving the next day. By that time an angry mob had gathered seeking revenge for the killings of two well-liked men.What happened next involves the fallen pine tree just beyond the plaque. This has long been know by local residents as "The Hanging Tree". &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The mill employed a number of the local Ottawa Indians, many of whom had limited English language skills. Wright had often utilized Peter Lahala as an interpreter. One can assume that the European workers might have been jealous of Lahala’s elevated status and frequent contact with the boss. For whatever reason, the mob claimed that he had knowledge of Wright’s whereabouts. Lahala denied any knowledge of Wright's whereabouts. Under the direction of the sheriff, a rope was placed around his neck and the other end thrown over a limb of the tree. The Indian was hoisted into the air. After a short time, he was lowered and again asked where Wright could be found. When no answer was given, he was hoisted up again and the sheriff is reported to have said, "Just kick your legs when you're ready to talk". Before this grim game could be played out to it's somber conclusion, Wright was dragged out of the woods by some men who had captured him and Peter Lahala was released. Wright was convicted and sentenced to life at hard labor in Jackson Prison. Upon his conviction, his wife divorced him and remarried. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In 1900 Governor Pingree apparently decided that local politics had played a role in the incident and commuted his sentence. He was released and, or so the story goes, stopped in Aral on his way to Wisconsin. He visited his ex and her new husband and sang "Their Song" for her one last time. She was so over come that she rushed weeping into his arms, abandoned her new spouse on the spot and sailed off into the sunset with murderer Charles Wright.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The second notable event in the history of Aral occurred from about 1908 to 1911 and also involves the hanging tree. The mill and town became an outpost of the notorious "King" Ben Purcell's beard wearing, baseball playing, House of David cult from Benton Harbor. They used the tree as a light house, placing lights and lookouts in the tree to guide boats to their dock. They lumbered the cedar out the nearby swamps, using the logs as raw material for a shingle mill. Then as suddenly as they came, they abandoned the area. The last resident moved out in 1922 and the town's life was over&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Cache Description:&lt;/STRONG&gt; The cache is a small 1 quart clear plastic container located south of a campground near Michigan’s Shore to Shore Hiking Trail. You will find the campground entrance using the following coordinates; 44 degrees, 46.711 minutes North, 85 degrees, 56.334 minutes West. Park by the pump and walk south on the trail to the post marking the shore to shore trail. Follow the ridge east about .13 miles to the cache. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The plaque gives dates for the life of Aral.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Enter the ending date.&lt;BR&gt;Divide by the number of stores, and&amp;nbsp;subtract 595.5.&lt;BR&gt;Let the result equal A.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Subtract the starting date from the ending date&lt;BR&gt;Multiply by the number of stores. &lt;BR&gt;Add the number of letters in settler Robert’s last name. &lt;BR&gt;Let the result equal B.&lt;BR&gt;Divide both A and B by 1000. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;To find the cache coordinates, start with the coordinates given for the campground entrance.&lt;BR&gt;Subtract A from the latitude&lt;BR&gt;Subtract B from the longitude. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Feel free to email me to check your results.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Notes of Interest:&lt;/STRONG&gt; For ghost town aficionados, this cache is half way between two other ghost towns. The vanished village of Jack Town/Osborn is located at 44 degrees, 46.732 minutes north and 85 degrees, 58.375 minutes west. There is a cache there (GC911D). Further east is where the town of Oviatt used to be. The Wilson cemetery can be found at 44 degrees, 46.961 minutes north and 85 degrees, 53.716 minutes west. &lt;/P&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">After reading the cache page as well as some online reading and the information at stage one,  we feel like we have read a good book.  This was a fun cache because of the Michigan history.  After getting the necessary information from the sign, we did some exploring of the area.  We found Otter Creek and tried to imagine a town here.  Then we headed to the final area and took a nice morning walk to sign the logbook.
Thanks for a fun cache and a history lesson.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The cache is located in Leelanau County by the Cleveland Township Cemetery just south of the intersection of M-22 and Co. 669.  Park at the cemetery entrance.  THE CACHE AND CLUES ARE NOT INSIDE THE CEMETERY, but if you are interested in history, you might want to look around.  Walk down the gravel cemetery road and go behind the back fence.

If you saw the classic 1966 western movie directed by Sergio Leone for which the cache is named and remember how Blondie/the man with no name (Clint Eastwood) and Tuco (Eli Wallach) found the hidden gold, then you know what we are up to here.  According to Blondie, Bill Carson said that the gold was near the grave of Arch Stanton.  The coordinates are for Stanton’s “gravestone”.  

When you find it, the middle letter of the death month will let you know which cardinal direction to travel in next.  Add the second and fourth numbers of the death year and multiply the result by 5 to get the number of paces to walk.  Then go that many paces in that direction to find the gold (cache).  Don’t get greedy like Tuco and try to take all the gold, or you may end up the same way he did.

Jackson: The name on the grave is... 
Tuco: In the cemetary, okay, in the grave okay! But it must have a name or a number on it! Talk, damn you! 

Man With No Name: If you shoot me, you won't see a penny of that money. 
Angel Eyes: Why? 
Man With No Name: I'll tell you why 
[kicks the coffin lid open] 
Man With No Name: . Cause there's nothin' in here! 

Tuco: [trying to read a grave that is marked "Unknown"] Un-k... un-k... there's no name on it. 
Man With No Name: [showing him a stone] There's no name here, either. See, that's what Bill Carson told me. It was the grave marked "Unknown", right beside Arch Stanton.

Man With No Name: You see, in this world there's two kinds of people, my friend: Those with loaded guns and those who dig. You dig.

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">This is one of the fourteen caches that comprise the Shore to Shore
Geochallenge</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Garey Lake is the westernmost campground on the Shore to Shore
trail. It is on the road from one ghost town to another, from
Jacktown to Oviatt. Both were bustling lumber towns in their day.
Now, all traces of the towns are gone and in the case of Jacktown,
the only residents are in the cemetery. 
&lt;p&gt;The Michigan Shore-To-Shore Trail begins at Lake Michigan in
Empire and ends more than 200 miles east at Lake Huron near
Oscoda.The trail was created and is maintained by the Michigan
Trail Riders Association in cooperation with the DNR. Closed to
motorized traffic, it passes through meadows and forests where
possible and uses roadside shoulders where necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find and copy the number codes contained in all of the
containers in this 14 cache series. They will allow you to find and
unlock the Hopkins Creek cache and complete the Geochallenge.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 Commemorative high quality S2S T shirts have been created and will
be presented to ten members of the first teams to complete the
challenge. To be eligible, the members receiving shirts must
&lt;b&gt;all&lt;/b&gt; have participated in the quest and must &lt;b&gt;all&lt;/b&gt; be
present and listed when logging finds. After the complimentary T
shirts have been awarded, shirts will be available for purchase by
additional challenge finishers for their cost plus shipping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The first stage is a micro container in a campground on the shore
of tiny Garey lake. Within it are the coordinates to a large
container hidden along the path to the trail camp less than a
quarter of a mile to the west. In addition within each container is
a number/letter code. As with all geocaches, please leave the
containers at least as well hidden as they were when you found
them.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">2 weeks ago I got 11 of 14 of the S2S caches, so I'm back for more punishment. Basswoodbend said there was a problem with this cache, but I had no problem with it.  I parked in the right place, found the first stage quickly and had a great walk through the beautiful pine trees and got to see the leaves turning beautiful colors on the deciduous trees.  The final was near a whole bunch of treefalls, but I found it in short order.  I was smarter this time and scoped out what looked like good roads via Google maps, but took a short cut past a cache that I found before near a cemetery and ended up finding a puddle in the middle of the road big enough to swallow my car.  Nothing to do but drive on through!  On my way out, I found a paved way that helped reduce the wear and tear on my suspension.  I had a great time!   Thanks for the cache.

The area around you is filled with information about all that you have seen and done so far on your journey.  While you have indeed earned your rest, take a few minutes more to explore the nearby buildings and pieces of old time machinery in the area.  If you have time, follow the trail down to the nearby lighthouse and take a tour of that.  The view is worth the climb!Before you leave, note the name of the group that provided your resting place at the listed coordinates.

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This cache takes you to South Manitou Island – which is part of
the Sleeping Bear National Dunes National Lakeshore. Cache is
placed with the permission of the National Park Service. Cordinates
take you near the boat docks.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;South Manitou Island is located in Lake Michigan. It is
approximately 15 miles west of Leland, MI. It’s land mass is just
over 8 square miles and is nearly 3.6 miles long and 3.3 miles wide
in the longest and widest parts of the island. South Manitou Island
is part of a chain of islands that extends north to the Straits of
Mackinac. The island consists of a ridge of tilted layers of
limestone, buried under a blanket of glacial debris. When the Lake
Michigan water basin filled with water, the peaks of the ridge
remained exposed as islands forming the Manitou Islands.&lt;/p&gt;
South Manitou Island was created when the last glacier covered a
good part of North America 10,000 – 100,000 years ago. This glacier
is known as the Wisconsin Glacier. The Wisconsin Glacier reached
north from the St. Lawrence watershed, west into the Mississippi
watershed, east to New England, but stopped short of the Ohio River
to the south. The advancing ice was channeled into the lowlands now
occupied by The Great Lakes, Green Bay, and the Fox River. This
advancing ice is referred to as a lobe. The way in which these
lobes where shaped were due to highly resistant bedrock. As a
result the ice would move in the path of least resistance. There
were 6 major lobes of the Wisconsin Glacier. They include Langlade
Lobe, Green Bay Lobe, Lake Michigan Lobe, Ontario Lobe, and the
Saginaw, and Huron-Erie Lobes. South Manitou Island was formed as a
result of the Lake Michigan lobe of the Wisconsin Glacier moving
through the Lake Michigan basin. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;According to Native American mythology, perhaps a legend created
in more recent times, the traditional version of the Chippewa
legend goes that long ago the mother bear, Mishe Mokwa, and her two
cubs sought to cross Lake Michigan from the Wisconsin shore to
escape a great forest fire. The mother bear made it across, but her
twin cubs played and splashed instead of swimming hard to make it
across. They drowned in the lake, forming the two Manitou islands.
The Great Spirit, Manitou, marked the mother bear’s resting place
-The Sleeping Bear Dunes and raised North and South Manitou Islands
as the place where the cubs perished. The mother bear lies and
waits forever for her cubs to reach the shore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the mid 19th century the island was inhibited by European
immigrants. The US Lighthouse Service also established a permanent
settlement as well. In 1915 the U.S. Life-Saving Service became
part of the U.S. Coast Guard. The US Life-Saving Service / US Coast
Guard maintained the lighthouse from 1871 to 1958 which stands over
100 feet tall. That lighthouse is visible from the mainland. Most
island inhabitants farmed and would sell extra crops, produce, ice,
and wood to passing ships (in that day – steam ships). Between the
Manitou Islands and the shore of the mainland is what is referred
to as the Manitou Passage where ships heading both north and south
bound travel. South Manitou Island also was the only natural harbor
for 220 miles along the Michigan shore and was a convenient and
safe location for ships traveling between Chicago and the Straits
of Mackinac. Many ships would weather storms in it’s harbor. There
are no longer any active farms on the island – but original
buildings, barns, old machinery, and a cemetery are the only
remaining evidence of the island’s history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, South Manitou is enjoyed as part of the National Sleeping
Bear Dunes. Visitors typically are ferried to the island by the
Manitou Island Transit Company which docks at the island once per
day during the main tourist season and every few days during the
off season. Many hikers and back-packers alike hike this island for
the peace and solidarity that this remote wilderness island offers.
There are also motorized tours of the island available. The former
US Coast Guard station is now the island’s ranger station and is
closed to the public. There are over 50 found ship wrecks and over
100 unfound wreck locations in the Manitou Passage. There are,
however, protected by state and federal law. One of the most famous
ship wrecks in the Manitou Passage occurred on November 29, 1960
when the Fransisco Morazen ran around in 20 foot of water. The ship
and it’s superstructure are visible from the shore and is a popular
destination for underwater diving. One interesting fact is on the
southwest corner of the island there is a grove of large white
cedar trees. One of the fallen trees showed 528 growth rings,
dating its existence to pre-Columbus. Another fallen cedar was
estimated to have over 900 rings!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;To Log This Cache:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
1. Post a picture of you (your face must be clearly visible) at
your favorite spot on the island as part of your log. Additional
photos of any beautiful views are always encouraged.&lt;br&gt;
2. South Manitou Island was created from the Wisconsin Glacier.
Describe the topography of the island from your travels. Include
descriptions of the soil, rock formations, etc.&lt;br&gt;
3. Take a elevation reading at these coordinates and then again at
the highest point on the island that you happen to visit. What is
the difference. Explain what accounts for that difference in
elevation.&lt;br&gt;
4. Email me the answers to #2 and #3 using my profile.&lt;br&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Any logs that do not meet the requirements will be deleted at
the cache owner's discretion.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Enjoyed looking across the water at so many places I know so well. Amazed at how unspoiled the island is.

We hit the ground running, intending to get to the dunes on the west side in the time allotted, and succeeded, also visiting the Valley of the Giants and the wreck of the Morazon. Quite a lot of living in a stretch of four hours and eight miles[:D]. My favorite spot was definitely the dunes, with sweeping views of North Manitou and Sleeping Bear Dunes.

All in all an excellent daytrip with plenty of pleasant conversation along the way. We stopped in Fishtown, got a couple big slabs of smoked whitefish and put the pedal down for central Wisconsin via da' Yoop. Got home at 2:00 in the morning and had to work at 8:00. Ahhh...

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Lime Lake is one of the many small lakes located around the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore. The lake itself is warm, clean and has some good fishing. The sand bottom is void of rocks, therefore it’s great for swimming. The bottom slopes gradually on the east side of the lake until you get three or four hundred yards off then it drops suddenly. Some of the best fishing is right at the drop off, but only accessible by boat.
The north end of the lake has the remains of trees that were cut by a saw mill during the lumbering days. We are told that the mill workers would push the scrap wood out onto the ice. When the ice melted the wood would sink to the bottom where it has been for over 100 years. It is very cool to see.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This cache is to mark the area where I saw a large mysterious cat.  On 8/30/2009 I was northbound on Hwy M-22 and pulled to the side at a dirt road to turn around and head south.  While checking traffic to pull a U-turn something moving on my right caught my eye.  A large slender cat, at least 100lbs. It was larger than my Weimaraner.  It was crossing the side road where I pulled off, coming out of trees and disappeared into heavy brush.  What was unusual about this cat was it had a shorter tail.    

I was sure, what I saw was a Cougar so I  entered my sighting onto"Michigan Cougar Sightings"  www.savethecougar.org.  If you read the other postings you'll find that there is a second posting in the same county of a Cougar that has a docked tail.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">I have always wanted to place a cache in the middle of the Deadstream Swamp but after several conversations with a resident expert regarding: cougars, black bears, bobcats, Michigan Rattlers, mucky-muck swamp, mosquitos, odd-looking spiders, beavers as big as Black Labs, and silt deeper than my paddle...I decided to place one anyway!  The area is extremely beautiful.  The flora and fauna is magnificent.  If you paddle, this is the cache for you.  My oldest son and I have paddled this stretch several times over the past six years and he nicknamed the place "Dinosaur Swamp".&lt;p&gt;As you approach the cache, it is as if you are paddling back in time...go slowly...listen...smell...look around.  You will have stories to tell after this one, I promise.&lt;p&gt;There is a delicious treat waiting for the First and Second Finders...We hope you love Cherry Pie!  There are gift certificates for the first two diehards to try their luck!&lt;p&gt;Please email if you wish to have parking coordinates.  You can get fairly close by car (within a half mile) but you must reach this by paddle.  ENJOY </groundspeak:long_description>

We saw an otter, green herons, black and green goo, and yes, giant spiders, which caused quite a stir w/everett4. The beavers must have been napping but we'd like to thank them for building such a sturdy dam. It solidly held everett1,2,3 and 4, and the canoe when we dragged it over. This was definitely are most challenging find yet. Thanks for a fabulous afternoon adventure!

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Our family has vacationed in this area for years and couldn't wait to try this one. We put in on Deadstream Rd and canoed to the stream, crossed the beaver dam (he must not have been home) and looked and looked. This was not a hardship since it is very pretty and fun to explore. But we did not find it. We did not have a GPS and we relied on our iPhone navigation. The accuracy was not consistant and at times showed us on one side then the other of the cache. (Don't know if a handheld GPS will be better or not.) You simply can not get out and walk around so we had to look from the canoe, decide on a spot and step out on a log or something. We are disappointed that we didn't find it but the adventure was excellent. We'll try again next year for sure.</groundspeak:text>

Thanks for the adventure.

He hired me and the squaw to guide him up the Dead Stream!  North Branch to be exact.  He said he wanted to go "Beaver Bashin" or "Gee-Oh Cachin" or somethin' like that.  We showed him the way up the crick.  He jumped out - grabbed up a first aid kit, pulled a pig from his pocket and dropped her right in the treasure box he'd found.  Those city folks have some strange ways!

Thanks, Johnny, for a great excuse to go paddling!  Maybe I'll get one of those Gee-Pea-Esses for Fathers' Day.

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">This cache starts in Cedar, Michigan and requires a kayak or canoe to get to it. Victoria Creek is full of wildlife and surounded by wetlands and swamp land.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">You are in for an adventure! You can park and launch your boat in Cedar just north of Pleva's Meat Market. Be sure to stop in and pick up some beef jerky and sausages while in Cedar! You will see the parking area and bridge crossing County road 616.

Be sure to take your camera as mink, otter, beaver and waterfowl are common sightings! Bug repellant and sunscreen are recommended too.

The creek will take you all the way out to the south end of Lake Leelanau but the cache is hidden about half way to the lake.

You will be able to reach it from your boat with care. Be sure to put it back in the same spot so it cannot be seen by passerby!

Cache is a standard ammo box with the usual fare as well as a couple of cool DVD movies as a reward to the first two finders! 

If you have a camera post a picture from your adventure please! Smiles are required too!</groundspeak:long_description>

Someone else commented that you shouldn't be a slave to the GPS - the 2-track road IS there - just keep looking!  Drove within a few hundred feet, but recent heavy rains had one section looking pretty iffy.  We used the old fashioned method of travel - FEET!  Found the cache in good shape.  Left a gold doubloon, a mini deck of cards, and a signature card.  Removed the essential oil to prevent freezing and damage to the cache.

This cache is located west of Traverse City on the north side of Cedar Run Rd. by the former Traverse City Area Public Schools Buffalo Springs Camp.  Local schools used to take students camping there until it was closed as an economy measure.  Park along the road by the chain across the old entrance driveway at N 444 45.681  W 085 47.955   The cache is a plastic jar with screw-on lid.

Then one of them found a rock she wanted to keep and carried it all the way out. Kids!!! We saw no one all the way in, but when we were at the spot looking for the cache two women ran by and one asked if we had found the cache! Interesting timing. We took the light up pig key chain travel bug and will put it in the next cache we find. I also plan to return to the cache tomorrow and put in it a geocoin travel bug that we found in a cache in Jonesville Michigan. </groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Back in the late 1920’s during the prohibition era, a fellow named Tony Tootino and his brother Louie were up in  Honor from the Chicago area getting a load of whiskey. Bootleggers as they were commonly called, tried to keep a low profile in the area. The local sheriffs had an idea where the stills were and knew about the brothers from Chicago, but tended to look the other way as long as the whiskey stayed home. They did have a concern about bootleggers hauling it downstate or out of state, this the sheriffs would not put up with.
	On this one particular day, Tony and Louie were out on Deadstream road where a backwoods still had a load of whiskey waiting for them. They hid the whiskey behind a false panel in the trunk that went under the rear seat of the car.
	On their way through town they stopped at Maley park to get a drink of water from the flowing artesian well, that’s still flowing today. 
	At the same time they were at the park the local sheriffs got a tip that the brothers were in town and were heading back to Chicago with a car load of whiskey. Not to miss a chance to bust the brothers the sheriffs went into action and in no time they had the brothers pinned in between them as they blocked both entrances to the park. 
	Tony saw what was happening and quickly grabbed his gun and started firing, he would never go down without a fight. He and his brother dove behind the car and came up with a plan. Tony would shoot out the tires on the car in front and Louie would get the one in the back. 
	The sheriffs never saw it coming and before they could react both sheriff’s cars had flat tires. The deputies were now firing back from both ends of the park but the brothers dove into the car and drove up the bank and onto Deadstream Rd.. With a shot out rear window, the brothers escaped and were never seen again, or so they thought.
	Back at the park one of the deputies had been shot in the leg and the others were assisting him. A wrecker was sent out with new tires and a few of the other deputies were cleaning up the park picking up all the spent shells. 
	Later that day Dr. Stiles was busy removing the bullet from the deputies leg and when he got it out he washed it off and gave it to the deputy for a souvenir. That evening the deputy went back to the station and showed his souvenir to the others. Deputy Shaw who was a gun collector looked at the bullet and realized that it was not the caliber of any of the shells they picked up at the park. With the mystery bullet, an order was sent out to search the park for a spent shell that matched the bullet. After a complete check of the area,  the search was called off and the shell was never found. All of the deputies guns were checked in case it may have been friendly fire but this too did not pan out. 
	The mystery of the bullet was never solved and many stories began of who really shot the deputy and why. Bootlegging continued for some time and the sheriffs were kept  busy finding new stills and arresting the owners,  but never did it come down to a shoot out like the one in Maley park.


Disclaimer: The story you have just read, may or maynot be true, this, you will have to decide for yourself. For me, I think its totally made-up and just an excuse to put a cache in Maley Park.</groundspeak:long_description>

Lake Ann, a village in Benzie County, Michigan, was incorporated in 1893.  The first settler to Lake Ann was A. P. Wheelock, building a cabin along the shores of the lake.  He named the village after his wife, Ann.  As with other communities in Benzie County, Lake Ann needed a railroad.  The Manistee and North Eastern Railroad was built and passed through Lake Ann.  The train left Traverse City in the morning and went to Manistee and returned to Traverse City in the evening.  The mail was sorted on  the train, and the sorter kicked the mail bag out at any village on the way.  When the Manistee and North Eastern Railroad was built, Lake Ann began to grow and commercial ventures were expanding.  Elijah Ransom built and ran a grist mill on a creek.  William Habbler, an Ohio resident, came to Lake Ann and built a large sawmill.

On the Fourth of July 1897, the village of Lake Ann had no special celebrations planned.  However a great fireworks display began at 1:30 in the afternoon when a fire broke out at Habbler’s sawmill.  Fire broke out throughout the village and 72 of the 88 buildings in the community burned to the ground.  With this mill and the stave factory gone, many homes and stores destroyed, a large number of the one thousand residents moved away.

Today, Lake Ann, a beautiful resort area, is a quiet place to enjoy the natural beauty of its surroundings.  Camping is available at the Lake Ann State Forest Campground situated on the west shore of Lake Ann.  The area’s activities include water sports, fishing, hiking, snowmobiling, cross country skiing, are just a few.  A visit to the Almira Historical Society Museum is an enlightening view to the past.  The museum is open on Tuesday and Saturdays from 1-5 pm during the months of May through October.

Lake Ann, a village rich in history and natural beauty, is a great place to visit or to stay forever.</groundspeak:long_description>

Walked the two trail loops here on Whaleback the day after Labor Day.  Under sunny skies and with temperatures in the upper 70s all week and only an occasional mosquito, we were indeed blessed.  Visiting the Leland/Leelanau area where our family vacationed in the late 1950s before relocating to Southern California.  Gecko Grandma and I visited cabins we used to stay in on the southwest shore of the north lake and discovered they have changed hardly any from 49 years ago.  Amazing.  She stayed to rest back at Leland Lodge while I went out for some exercise.  I stopped off at the lookout before searching for the cache.  Great view of Lake Michigan – you could see seemingly forever.  Left a rainbow lizard and a LIVEStrong wristband.  Took Star Wars Domehead Geocoin for a ride back to Lucasland.  Thanks for the hide.

While its size and color will not make it stand out, it still represents an object greatly out of place in a dense forest.  You won’t want to stay long as the bugs around the area a particularly fierce!To log the cache, send an email along with a description of the object.

Unlike the previous night, we didn't bother to do the dirty work bushwacking, so we found ourselves approaching this one much sooner than originally expected. That was probably a good thing, because with the limited battery life left in the GPSr along with the dense tree cover we couldn't get a good read on this one. We ventured off the trail, dropped our packs and found some interesting things, but not what we were expecting. Then we turned off the GPSr, read some of the previous logs along with re-reading the description and stumbled across this oddity. Patience certainly was the winner here.</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">After putting away our GPSr yesterday, then doing the paper and compass thing we had quite an adventure that lead us through the woods on no trail at all. We were rewarded with our tough hikes by a magnificent view from the backside of a parabolic dune. The next morning we pulled the GPSr out and saw that we were less than half a mile from this one. After pumping water from the lake we took a nice easy trail right to this structure, made note of it, and it looks like something my great grandparents had on their farm that we used to play on as kids. Then we went on to the barn and found it was in really good shape compared to the shack and house nearby. Cool sights and history here, thanks for getting us a smiley to go along with our adventures.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Honor is a village in Benzie County, Michigan and is the home of the State Fish Hatchery and of the National Coho Festival held every August.

After he saw the Platte River Valley, an Englishman and industrialist, Joseph A. Gifford, saw a place of great possibilities for opportunity.  He founded the town of Honor, which he named for his daughter, Honor.  The town prospered for twenty years.  Gifford started the Guelph Patent Cask Company which made wooden containers from the timbers in the area. In 1895 two railroads, the Pere Marquette and the Manistee and Northern, reached Honor to transport the timber. With the advent of the railroads, Honor soon was a village with activity at the saw mills and a bustling village economy. The town soon had almost a thousand inhabitants.  The town’s success and growth was so spectacular that the county seat was moved there in 1908.  However by 1915, the forests in the hills and valleys around the Platte River were just littered with stumps and tinder.  Mills closed down and the railroads left Honor, with many workers moving on.
Finally, the county seat was moved to Beulah on the shores of Crystal Lake.

Today Honor is known for hunting and fishing on the Platte River, as well as canoeing and other recreational activities.  Situated at the mouth of the Platte River and a part of the Sleeping Bear National Lakeshore, the Platte River Campgrounds, located on the pristine shores of Lake Michigan, are enjoyed by outdoors enthusiasts.  Another landmark in Honor enjoyed by generations of families, is the Cherry Bowl Drive-In.  The Cherry Bowl continues to show double feature family friendly first run films for over fifty years.  Another Northern Michigan treasure!  Honor, a small village, with a big heart, come and enjoy the many activities and scenic beauty.</groundspeak:long_description>

     The clarity of the water is amazing, you can see bottom in 10 to 12 feet of water which came in handy when you lost something overboard.
     The history of Crystal Lake is very interesting and a plaque can be found at the beach in the park in Beulah.
     As always, please return the cache as you found it.
Happy Caching.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font color="blue"&gt;What&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For the third year for our Survivor Event - we are re-visiting
North Manitou Island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now here is a camping trip! 15,000 acres of wilderness with a
visitor use concept that emphasizes solitude, self-reliance and a
sense of exploration. Camping on North Manitou is "open" - you
choose the campsite! The primary visitor activities include hiking,
swimming, backcountry camping, hunting (during certain designated
times), fishing and backpacking. The island itself is home to a
large whitetail deer herd and is the summer range for a variety of
raptors (including the Bald Eagle). In the fall, special trips are
available for hunters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font color="blue"&gt;When&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The scheduled date will be June 27 2010 - 9am in front of the
ranger station. You'll find us at the nearest picnic table. As
mentioned - the official event date is June 27th. However, we
highly recommend you show up at least a few days early and enjoy
Michigan's great outdoors!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Join us once again for this annual unique opportunity of a 5/5
event. In order for you to join us - you must either have your own
personal watercraft (not allow to be docked for more than 20
minutes) or ferry over to the island the previous day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font color="blue"&gt;Who&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Everyone with a sense of adventure is invited to this exciting
event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font color="blue"&gt;Why&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Those who are looking for an adventure will find it here on North
Manitou Island. North Manitou Island is home to some of the most
unique parts of the United States. Roughly 5% of the land mass in
the U.S. is officially designated by Congress as a Wilderness Area.
Of that 5% number - 3% is wilderness in Alaska. The remaining 2% is
scattered thoughout the rest of the country. Be part of hikers and
backpackers who have been on North Manitou Island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font color="blue"&gt;How&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Access to the island is by boat only. There is a ferry service that
runs once per day that goes to both North and South Manitou
Islands. It is run by
&lt;a href="http://www.leelanau.com/manitou/manitou.html"&gt;Manitou
Island Transit&lt;/a&gt;. Recommendation - book your tickets in advance
otherwise there may not be room on the ferry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font color="blue"&gt;Resources&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Couldn't claim this virtual back then due to construction, but today all is well. Requested information has been sent.

You should find this cache shortly after you disembark from your ferry trip to the island.  Make sure you check in with the ranger before exploring the area.The buildings you see started out as a volunteer operation Lifesaving in 1854.  The station was taken over by the newly-formed U.S. Life-Saving Service in 1874, and became part of the U.S. Coast Guard in 1915.  The station continued in operation until and operated until 1938, when it was sold to the Manitou Island Association. For many years the buildings were used for employee housing and general operation of an island hunting preserve. The National Park Service acquired the land in 1984, and today it is part of the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Seashore. For nearly ninety years the North Manitou Island Lifesaving Station was a key element in the network of nearly 200 rescue stations developed by the federal government. This network provided aid to shipwreck victims. The North Manitou Island Station is the only remaining station that represents the entire lifesaving service history from the volunteer era through the Coast Guard era.  Because this station saw no interruption in service, the station buildings retain a high level of integrity of design, material, and workmanship.To log this cache, send an email that includes the date of dedication of the area as posted on the stone pillar at the listed coordinates.  Feel free to post a photo of you in front of the historic buildings as long as answer is not shown.</groundspeak:long_description>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">We had been talking about coming to the Manitou Islands for a long time, and when we did MM1 about a year ago, it really started to itch at us. This year we have an Isle Royal trip planned, so we had to do some shakedown trips. PERFECT! We were able to get  a boat ride in, then a good amount of hiking. Too bad we weren't able to join the event crew last weekend, but we had a great time on the island, and learned some more history on our way out. Wish we would have seen the back side of the welcome sign on our way in. Lots of history there.

is part of the Sleeping Bear National Dunes National Lakeshore.
Cache is placed with the permission of the National Park Service.
The sign is very interesting but there is nothing here for this
earth cache. Read below to find what you need to do to be able to
log it.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;North Manitou Island is located in Lake Michigan. It is
approximately 12 miles west-northwest of Leland, MI. It is nearly 8
miles long and over 4 miles wide and has 20 miles of shoreline. The
island consists of a ridge of tilted layers of limestone, buried
under a blanket of glacial debris. When the Lake Michigan water
basin filled with water, the peaks of the ridge remained exposed as
islands forming the Manitou Islands. During post-glacial times,
winds blowing on the high, sandy bluffs on the west side of the
island moved sand inland, forming perched dunes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;North Manitou Island was created when the last glacier covered a
good part of North America 10,000 – 100,000 years ago. This glacier
is known as the Wisconsin Glacier. The Wisconsin Glacier reached
north from the St. Lawrence watershed, west into the Mississippi
watershed, east to New England, but stopped short of the Ohio River
to the south. The advancing ice was channeled into the lowlands now
occupied by The Great Lakes, Green Bay, and the Fox River. This
advancing ice is referred to as a lobe. The way in which these
lobes where shaped were due to highly resistant bedrock. As a
result the ice would move in the path of least resistance. There
were 6 major lobes of the Wisconsin Glacier. They include Langlade
Lobe, Green Bay Lobe, Lake Michigan Lobe, Ontario Lobe, and the
Saginaw, and Huron-Erie Lobes. North Manitou Island was formed as a
result of the Lake Michigan lobe of the Wisconsin Glacier moving
through the Lake Michigan basin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Native American mythology, perhaps a legend created
in more recent times, the traditional version of the Chippewa
legend goes that long ago the mother bear, Mishe Mokwa, and her two
cubs sought to cross Lake Michigan from the Wisconsin shore to
escape a great forest fire. The mother bear made it across, but her
twin cubs played and splashed instead of swimming hard to make it
across. They drowned in the lake, forming the two Manitou islands.
The mother bear lies and waits forever for her cubs to reach the
shore - the Sleeping Bear Dunes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early island settlers would stop by North Manitou to supply cord
woods for steam ships sailing the Great Lakes. Later on other’s
used the timber resources of North Manitou Island in both raw and
cut boards. Other settlers attempted farming on the island. They
had apple and cherry orchards which didn’t work out all that well
because of the soil on the island. Additionally it was also
difficult to transport the produce off of the island back to the
mainland. In the late 19th century – North Manitou became a summer
get-a-way and many small homes and/or cottages were built. The
United States Government took over the island in 1974. Most of
those cottages, homes, and other buildings have naturally decayed
or have been torn down as the island has no permanent residents.
The only “permanent” residents are the rotating National Park
Rangers who stay in the village on the eastern part of the
island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deer and other game were artificially introduced to the island
for gaming purposes. Today the deer have caused great harm to the
natural environment on the island because of the lack of natural
predators. Beaver are found on the island because they are good
swimmers. White-footed mice and chipmunks have made it to the
island by methods unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, North Manitou is enjoyed as part of the National Sleeping
Bear Dunes. Visitors typically are ferried to the island by the
Manitou Island Transit Company which docks at the island once per
day. Many hikers and back-packers alike hike this island for the
peace and solidarity that this remote island offers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;To Log This Cache:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
1. Post a picture of you (your face must be clearly visible) at
your favorite spot on the island as part of your log. Additional
photos of any beautiful views are encouraged.&lt;br /&gt;
2. North Manitou Island was created from the Wisconsin Glacier.
Describe the topography of the island from your travels. Include
descriptions of the soil, rock formations, etc.&lt;br /&gt;
3. Take a elevation reading at these coordinates and then again at
the highest point on the island that you happen to visit. What is
the difference. Explain what accounts for that difference in
elevation.&lt;br /&gt;
4. Email me the answers to #2 and #3 using my profile. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Each Cacher that logs a find is required to submit answers to
the questions above (failure to comply will result in a deletion of
your log). The only exception to this are young kids that are
caching with their parents (who have their own account, but not
computer privileges). Per Earthcache guidelines, each cacher is to
learn from their visit/experience. That means each cacher must
perform the necessary task(s) or requirements to log the cache and
earn your smiley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any logs that do not meet the above posted requirements will be
deleted at the discretion of the cache owner. &lt;b&gt;All logging
requirements must be completed within 48 hours of logging the cache
online or your log will be deleted unless you have prior permission
from the cache owner&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

We were quite rewarded with a neat informative sign concerning the nearby structure. Then it was time to say goodbye to the island. All totalled, we did about 19 miles, some backtracking and some off trail hiking too. Thanks for getting us thinking geological during our stay.</groundspeak:text>

Barely scratched the surface of the island despite hiking over 25 miles for the 3-days but got to see a lot in that time though. Looking back through the altitude log, I was surpised at the elevations we reached, although if "these dogs could talk"...

Lots of places were enjoyed around the island. Will get the photos up when I get them from the various "photogs" in our group. But swimming in Lake Michigan on the West side of the island was probably my favorite experience. That was very refreshing.

The Pirate Eye is all knowing -but needs light through it to see
the way. When ya find the Pirate Eye, place your lantern over the
Eye to light the path. &lt;br /&gt;
Three Northern Stars shall then lead the way to the next Pirate
Eye. But, take heed,... the eyes are finite, so count yer steps-
there are ONLY SO MANY. The 'X' marks the true ending, but not
without a final riddle. So, good luck to ya land lubbers, and let
The Pirate Eye lead you down the true path out o' the Hangman's
Yard. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Touch lightly the Eyes, as they be fragile.&lt;br /&gt;
The slightest jarring, can lose the path for all.&lt;br /&gt;

ground at the end of a two track.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The basis for this now public cemetery is the Brundage family
burial site originally located on the family farm. The Brundage
family, like many of the early settlers in Michigan, migrated from
upper New York state after the opening of the Erie Canal in 1825. 
&lt;p&gt;The family settled in Eaton County but young D.C. and his wife
Mary struck out on their own and settled here in what eventually
became Inland Township, Benzie County.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
With the help of their three sons, they farmed the land and built a
dam on the creek that bears their name. Here, for many years they
successfully operated a shingle mill that took advantage of the
forested land that they had to clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Like many farms in the North Country, the land was much better for
growing trees than crops and the lack of income forced the land to
revert to the State for nonpayment of taxes. The burial grounds
however were kept in private hands. Today it is owned by the
Brundage Cemetery Corporation and is available for the internment
of cremains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
As you leave your car, just past the sign, you will see the word
"Basswood" on the ground. To find the cache, SUBTRACT a Basswood, a
Beech, a Walnut, and a Maple from the West coordinates. (994)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then ADD 3 Basswoods, 2 Spruce, 2 Apples, a Hickory, a Tamarack,
a Wild Cherry, (If the Tent worms have left any.) and an Ash to the
North coordinates. (138)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is an ammo can outside the cemetery grounds on State
land.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This cache takes you to Lake Manitou in the middle of North
Manitou Island – which is part of the Sleeping Bear National Dunes
National Lakeshore. Cache is placed with the permission of the
National Park Service.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Lake Manitou is a very interesting geological feature. It is a
freshwater lake on an island in the middle of another larger lake –
in this case Lake Michigan. Lake Manitou occupies a low lying area
in the north-central portion of the island. It is the larger of the
two inland lakes found on the island. It is roughly 1.2 miles in
length and close to .5 miles wide at its widest spot. Beautiful
clear water can be found along with a variety of fish lure many of
the island’s visitors to the lake. To the west of the lake the
terrain becomes very rugged as you approach the west and northwest
bluffs. The bluffs are very incised and steep between Swenson's and
the Pot Holes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;North Manitou Island along with Lake Manitou and Tamarack Lakes
were created when the last glacier covered a good part of North
America 10,000 – 100,000 years ago. This glacier is known as the
Wisconsin Glacier. The Lake Michigan Lobe of that glacier created
the Lake Michigan water basin along with the Manitou Islands. The
way in which these lobes where shaped were due to highly resistant
bedrock. As a result the ice would move in the path of least
resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, Lake Manitou is enjoyed by all of the hikers, backpackers
, and fishermen who visit the island. If one were to fish there are
several options available. Wading, porting from the Ferry Dock a
canoe or some other watercraft, or suggestions have been made to
bring a tube! To visit Lake Manitou one would have to be ferried to
North Manitou Island by the Manitou Island Transit Company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;To Log This Cache:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
1. Post a picture of you (your face must be clearly visible) where
Lake Manitou clearly in the background. &lt;br /&gt;
2. North Manitou Island was created from the Wisconsin Glacier.
Describe the topography of the surrounding area of the lake.
Include in your answer specifics where you can see evidence of the
lake created by the glacier. Include descriptions of the soil, rock
formations, etc.&lt;br /&gt;
 3. Take an elevation reading at Lake Manitou. &lt;br /&gt;
4. Email me the answers to #2 and #3 using my profile. 
&lt;p&gt;Each Cacher that logs a find is required to submit answers to
the questions above (failure to comply will result in a deletion of
your log). The only exception to this are young kids that are
caching with their parents (who have their own account, but not
computer privileges). Per Earthcache guidelines, each cacher is to
learn from their visit/experience. That means each cacher must
perform the necessary task(s) or requirements to log the cache and
earn your smiley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any logs that do not meet the above posted requirements will be
deleted at the discretion of the cache owner. &lt;b&gt;All logging
requirements must be completed within 48 hours of logging the cache
online or your log will be deleted unless you have prior permission
from the cache owner&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This was our last 'find' of the day, but we kept thinking about the formation of the island, and the lake especially for the rest of our hike. We would point out different things and say "See, there WAS a glacier here!" After getting to MM#4 straight off the boat then skirting the south shore of the lake we decided to take the first extended stop of our hike to enjoy the sights of the lake, and get a snack and some more water before heading on. It was a good thing too, because we didn't see any sign of the trail for the next two and a half hours! This was just the beginning of what we would later realize (once we got home and saw the GPSr track) of full pack bushwhack for about 2miles looking for an 'unmaintained' trail that we are pretty sure isn't there. It was fun resorting to old school compass and paper as a primary navigation source since the GPSr didn't have these trails marked, and the offroading through the woods wasn't too bad here, plus it was early in the day so we had plenty of time to get lost then find our way out of it. </groundspeak:text>

It is fun to walk the grounds, see the trademark VV surreal golf features, and how quickly nature reclaimed the land!  

Parking: 44 55.167, 85 41.639 (5 min) or 44 55.135, 85 41.944 (10-15 min but more fun!).

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Located on the Veronica Valley County Park (old Veronica Valley Golf Course), this piece of land was a very unusual golf course!  For a number of years it existed as a fun, imaginative, family-run golf course with a number of unusual feathres.  This included Rapunzel's tower (with her golden hair hanging out), giant statues, sunken ships, etc.  It had the fun of a putt-putt golf course placed in an adult golf course.  The golf course closed years back, and in 2009 Leelanau County purchased it and opened it to the public as a park.  It is fun and amazing to walk the grounds and see how quickly nature has reclaimed the land.  The features that made it a surreal golf course make it an even more surreal county park!  Compare your experience to google maps satellite view when you return as you walk the greens and sandtraps on a hike.  

The cache is "guarded" by one of the landmark features.  The park has two parking lots.  The nearest is at 44 55.167, 85 41.639 (5 min to cache) but we strongly suggest you explore the park/course more by parking at the farther lot at 44 55.135,  85 41.944 (10-15 min to cache depending on your choice of trails). 

The cache is a small plastic container about 5x5x5 inches in size, with a camo paint job.  The cache sits at ground level.  We filled it with some of the best treats we had including petoskey pendents, bracelets and necklaces, new matchbox cars, movie promotional items and mini-CD's, minibooks, tattoo's, etc.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Long Lake Twp. has a rich history and this cache is located literally within feet of the exact physical center of the township.

The Long Lake township area was initially settled in 1862 when Ira Chase and his brother-in-law Eliphalet Fillmore traveled from Whitewater township to Grand Traverse County to select land. The next few years saw the gradual influx of families who cleared forested areas to establish farms. An annual cycle of farming in the summer, logging in the winter, and maple sugaring in the spring began. The end of the Civil War brought additional settlers and in November 1866 a group of men petitioned the Board of Supervisors of Grand Traverse County to form "Viola" township. In January 1867, Long Lake township was formally organized.

In the 1920's J. Ogden Armour, the Bill Gates of that era, built a summer estate on Long Lake with about a mile and one half of lake front, a 14,000 Square foot log home with 11 fireplaces, a cottage for his secretary, two boat houses, a guest house, and supplied its own food from a farm that housed 30 people.  The estate is still there.

The famed golfer, Walter Hagen, made his home on Long Lake in his later years.

Long Lake is the home to well known jazz muscian Bob James and many other prominant people.

 Since Crescent Shores Dr is a private road and does not allow parking pull off to the inner circle side of the road opposite the side the houses are on.  Property owner will allow you there within proximity of the first waypoint (N 44 43.891  W 085 45.567) . At the first waypoint look for a 4x4 wood post with a green sign that has four digits.  Use the top two digits in their present order to form a number you will subtract from the latitude of the waypoint.  Then subtract the top digit from the second digit.  Subtract that difference from the longitude of the waypoint.  You now have the coordinates to locate the cache.  The area has a heavy canopy of trees but this should get you within 20 feet of the cache.   The final waypoint is several feet off of the road.  The cache is placed with permission of the property owner.  The cache is an ammo box containing a pen and log book to sign, fishing de-liar, spare AAA bateries in case yours are low, a shoe horn, and 2 marbles in case you lost a few along the way.  Take something and leave something.

The first Cache is on Picnic Island in Long Lake (does not appear on Google Maps), in a small Camo tupperware container.  You may have to look hard to find it.  Inside you will find a clue to the next cache location.  Be VERY observant, and you shouldn't have any problem.  Please leave the first cache location how you found it, this means leave it with all of the original contents.  The first cache is only for the clue, please save any trade items for the final cache even though there is plenty of room for them in the first destination.  The final cache is big enough for most trade items, I was able to fit a mason jar in it once if that is any help.  As for a more specific location or what you're looking for at the final location, you're on your own!! Have fun, bring your thinking caps!

But no idea of the magnitude of the storm until we walked across the center of the island -- I wouldn't suggest that route!!!

Beulah is a picturesque village, and the county seat for Benzie Co. Michigan, and situated on the shores of beautiful Crystal Lake.  Long known as a summer vacation place, Beulah was founded in 1880 by Rev. Charles E. Bailey.  He names the village for a place described in the Bible.  Without Archibald Jones of Illinois who came to the area in 1872, we wouldn’t have the lovely shoreline of Crystal Lake.  Jones’ idea was to build a canal from Crystal Lake and the Betsie River, he organized the Betsie River Improvement Company and sold stock in his company.  No surveys were made, and in the summer of 1873 the work began  at the outlet of Crystal Lake.  An opening was made and the water of the lake were released.  For days the water flowed out and lowered the level of  the lake.  While the original idea of Jones was a failure, it created a beautiful beach around the lake.  It made the area ready for the village of Beulah and for the summer cottages and homes now surrounding the lake.  Some people describe this lowering of the lake as “The Tragedy of Crystal Lake”, however those of us who enjoy our summer homes are most grateful.  Separating from Benzonia, Beulah was given its own post office in 1892.

The village has many interesting shops and delightful eateries and there are many recreational activities throughout the year.  The natural beauty of the surroundings make Beulah a wonderful place to visit for a day or forever!</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Betsie Valley Trail is 22 miles long, goes from Frankfort’s Lake Michigan Beach to Thompsonville, providing an excellent trail for bikers and walkers.  This Trail was built on the tracks of the former Ann Arbor Railroad.  From 1892 until 1982 freight cars were carried across Lake Michigan on car ferries owned by the Ann Arbor Railroad.  In 1998 Michigan’s Department of Natural Resources bought the rail corridor to develop this Trail.   If you bike this Trail, you will travel through Benzie County’s Railroad Point Natural Area with access to Crystal Lake, along the Betsie River, through the Pere Marquette State Forest, through wetlands and wildlife areas.  There is a 3-mile long section of the trail that ends at Crystal Mountain.  During the winter months the trail from Beulah to Thompsonville, is open to snowmobiles.

The Betsie Valley Trail is an excellent way to enjoy beautiful views, a healthy way to exercise and a truly enjoyable experience.  Load up your bikes, find this cache and cycle off on this wonderful trail.</groundspeak:long_description>

Geochallenge
</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Lake Dubonnet is a 1000 acre impoundment of the upper Platt River.
In addition to excellent pan fishing, it has a floating island that
periodically takes it upon itself to change locations, If you visit
in the evening you will hear the quintessential sound of "UP
North", the call of a Loon. The lake boasts a nesting pair. We have
also noticed quite a bit of beaver activity although not the pesky
critters themselves. 
&lt;p&gt;The Michigan Shore-To-Shore Trail begins at Lake Michigan in
Empire and ends more than 200 miles east at Lake Huron near
Oscoda.The trail was created and is maintained by the Michigan
Trail Riders Association in cooperation with the DNR. Closed to
motorized traffic, it passes through meadows and forests where
possible and uses roadside shoulders where necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find and copy the number codes contained in all of the
containers in this 14 cache series. They will allow you to find and
unlock the Hopkins Creek cache and complete the Geochallenge.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Commemorative high quality S2S T shirts have been created and will
be presented to ten members of the first teams to complete the
challenge. To be eligible, the members receiving shirts must
&lt;b&gt;all&lt;/b&gt; have participated in the quest and must &lt;b&gt;all&lt;/b&gt; be
present and listed when logging finds. After the complimentary T
shirts have been awarded, shirts will be available for purchase by
additional challenge finishers for their cost plus shipping.&lt;/p&gt;
The cache is a plastic nut jar about 1/4 mile from the campground.
You can drive fairly close. As with all caches, please take the
time to return it to its hiding place and conceal it at least as
well as when you found it. 
&lt;p&gt;The fourteen caches in the S2S Geo-challenge are;&lt;br&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">The old GPSr must have routed me the wrong way. I never found the campground.  The roads were good, then pretty good, and then suddenly I was on a sandy 2-track with no place to stop or turn around.  My Prius doesn't have the ground clearance or the right tires for these sandy roads.  Luckily I found a place to get off the road (if you can call it a road) and hiked the remaining 2/3 of a mile to the cache.  I was sure glad I stopped the car when I did.  I never would have made it out without help.  The hike was nice, but I never did see the campground.  I found the cache in short order.  Nice hide.  The hike back with all those sandy trails was tiring, so I called it a day at about 6:30pm.  The drive out was a little more hair raising as I almost high centered on the sand once or twice.  When I finally made it to civilization, I thought that I probably could have made it to Empire to finish this out, but I decided it was best to leave some for another day (hopefully about 2 weeks from now).  #11 for the day in the S2S series.  Thanks for the cache.  A beautiful place.

container covered in camo duct tape.  The cache was 
hidden by Westwoods Summer Adventure campers and staff!  Inside are trinkets made by our campers 
(ages 4-12).  The cache is approximately a quarter 
of a mile from the trailhead and parking 
(N44 42.382, W085 46.670).  While there be sure to 
check out GC12BZF hidden by slowflyers!

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Crystal Lake, the ninth largest lake in Michigan, nestled in the woods, with sparkling, pristine waters, stunning sunsets, and peaceful tranquility, has been my family’s summer home for over 65 years. Six generations of my family has enjoyed the surrounding beauty of the forests and lakeshore activities with carefree days, family gatherings with  unending laughter and great fellowship. Vowing to return next summer, waiting for the year to go by, when we all can meet again, playing cards, board games, roasting hot dogs or marshmallows on the beach, lighting sparklers on the Fourth of July, just reading on the porch or snoozing on the chaise lounges.  This is my Crystal Lake, my refuge and my summer place.

So I invite you to visit and enjoy the four seasons of recreational activities, beautiful lighthouses, the gateway to the Sleeping Bear Lakeshore, and the most beautiful place on the Earth.  I have place this geocache near the shores of Crystal Lake in the hope of  bringing cachers to this special lake.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This cache has been place at a right of way to Crystal Lake, the seventh largest lake in Michigan.  And to me the most beautiful lake in the world!
A wonderful vacation spot for over one hundred years, families have enjoyed their visits to the shores of this pristine lake.  Known for water sports during the summers and for riding on ski mobiles and ice fishing during the winters when fishing shanties dot the frozen lake.  Every season of the year brings outdoor activities for enthusiasts to participate and to experience.

I can think of no place I would rather be than to be at Crystal Lake!  Looking out my bedroom window early mornings, seeing the beautiful sunrise with the black silhouettes of trees, watching the deer, the foxes at play and other wildlife in our backyard, the sun setting over the lake at dusk, this cannot be surpassed.  The cookouts, marshmallow roasting on the beach, swinging on the porch swing with a book in hand, long walks after dinner, visiting with old friends, playing board games or cards with the grandkids, all of these make our time at Crystal Lake special!  The peace and serenity of these surroundings will stay with you forever.</groundspeak:long_description>

This cache is named for our great granddaughters, Brooke, Autumn and Rayne, who enjoyed their vacation in northern Michigan.


Our great granddaughters came to visit us at our summer home and they decided that they should place a geocache in the woods nearby.  Their cousins who live in New Hampshire have placed several caches for people to find.  So this cache is dedicated to “Our Girls From Illinois” and hopefully others will enjoy finding their cache.  This is a camoed coffee can filled with stuff for kids to enjoy.</groundspeak:long_description>

We enjoyed finding this cache on our way to Beulah for lunch, after attending the Pumpkin/Harvest Festival in Frankfort.  After lunch, Mrs. Priscillaandfriends started developing some major cold symptoms, so alas, this was our only find for the day.  The rest of the day was spent curled up, reading a good book.

TRAILS&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Part of the Traverse Area Recreational Trail system, the 15.5 mile
Leelanau Trail is a non-motorized pathway connecting Traverse City
at its southern end point with Suttons Bay at its northern end
point. Running through the last of Leelanau County's former
railroad corridors, the Leelanau Trail creates the perfect setting
for transportation, recreation and environmental education. The
route stretches through rolling hills, lush forests, picturesque
orchards, peaceful meadows and an aquatic medley of streams, lakes
and ponds. 
&lt;p&gt;There are three trailheads along the trail: on Cherry Bend Road,
on Fouch Road, and at 4th Street in Suttons Bay. The trail is
currently paved for about 8.5 miles and unpaved for about 7 miles.
The paved sections are from M-72 West in Traverse City to Lakeview
Road in Elmwood Township and again from Revold Road in Bingham
Township to the depot in Suttons Bay. The unpaved surface is a
hard-packed dirt two-track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4" face="Times" color="red"&gt;It is not necessary to
jump through the sticker/pamphlet hoops to log this
cache.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got the idea for our Trekking Traverse Trails series from a
similar series in Florida. As a reward for the first 50 who wish
one and who complete the series, we have created a Path Tag on
which is the Traverse City logo. To acquire a tag, stop at the
Traverse City Visitors Center(
&lt;a href="http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=70e9c579-f72c-44c7-a0c3-b06d5830fd3b"&gt;
GC17HZ4&lt;/a&gt;), and pick up a free Trekking Traverse Trails
brochure.&lt;br /&gt;
In each cache container you will find a sticker for that cache.
Paste each of the ten stickers in the brochure, mail it in, and we
will sent you your tag.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The Tale of Frank Mud
     Rumor has it that several years ago a homley, woodsy man named Frank Mud lived in the surronding forest you are about to go to. He was known as a trapper, a prospector and unfortunately a loner. Perhaps it was from the huge red x shaped scar he had across his face that kept him in the woods and not around others. Some people say that it was a tatoo, while others still say it was from a fight with a bear. Not much was known about Frank Mud.....
     Supposedly, copper was what brought him to the area, an old friend of his said that he heard that copper could be found in the abundant forest of Northern Michigan. So he set out, looking in the thick,dense woods along small lakes and streams. Having no luck at all as a prospector (later he learned that it was further north in the U.P. that had the copper)he turned to trapping. Mink,beaver,raccoon and bear were very abundunt in the area and he made a good living.                                                          Occasionally, hunters and loggers would run into Frank, but he never talked much and mostly kept to himself.                                                   
     Many years later when Traverse City was taking shape along with Interlochen and Lake Ann, folks started to name the lakes, rivers and streams. People remembered Frank and thought it fitting to name a lake after him, so they came up with Mud Lake. Over the years it was changed to Lake Dubonnet, but the old timers still call it Mud Lake.
    Not much was known about Frank Mud after the town started to arise. Some people say he left the area and moved further North, others say he went back to his old life and moved back into town, others still say that he had a fight with a bear and loss. But I belive that Frank Mud still lives in the forest, roaming through the dense woods,trapping, fishing and keeping to himself.</groundspeak:long_description>

The village of Homestead was directly east of the settlement of Benzonia in Benzie Co. Michigan.  Homestead comprised of what is now Homestead, Zimmerman and Pioneer Roads.  Many pioneers came to the area for cheap land from the government paying $1.25 for an acre of land and promising to stay for at least five years.  Life was tough for these hardy settlers.  Early pioneers of Homestead were from northern Ohio, the same region from which  the Benzonia settlers came.  A man, Camden Johnson, described his journey to this area in 1864 from Ashtabula Co. Ohio.  Johnson said that the journey to Traverse City was uneventful till the group reached Traverse City.  Then the settlers found that the only way to Benzonia was to walk.  The family started early in the morning walking on a trail through the wilderness. When they arrived exhausted at 9 pm to a former Ohio neighbor’s home in Homestead, they were welcomed.  After building homes, the early settlers built churches and schools.  In  1864 a Congregational Church was built.  During the following year, the first school was built by volunteers out of a frame of poles and the walls and roof were covered with shake shingles.  Not enough protection during the winters, so school wasn’t in session in the winter months.  

With lumbering activities in the area of Homestead, the village grew rapidly with homes and businesses flourishing.  Railroads crisscrossed the area.  Again as many other communities, Homestead thrived during the lumbering era but declined as soon as the valuable timber was stripped from the landscape.  People had to leave the area to find  jobs elsewhere, and the little village of Homestead disappeared.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br /&gt;
Oh the night that Paddy Murphy died, is a night I'll never forget
&lt;br /&gt;
Some of the boys got loaded drunk, and they ain't got sober
yet;&lt;br /&gt;
As long as a bottle was passed around every man was feelin'
gay&lt;br /&gt;
O'Leary came with the bagpipes, some music for to play &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
Chorus:&lt;br /&gt;
That's how they showed their respect for Paddy Murphy&lt;br /&gt;
That's how they showed their honour and their pride;&lt;br /&gt;
They said it was a sin and shame and they winked at one
another&lt;br /&gt;
And every drink in the place was full the night Pat Murphy died
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As Mrs. Murphy sat in the corner pouring out her grief&lt;br /&gt;
Kelly and his gang came tearing down the street&lt;br /&gt;
They went into an empty room and a bottle of whiskey stole&lt;br /&gt;
They put the bottle with the corpse to keep that whiskey cold
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Chorus &lt;br /&gt;
About two o'clock in the morning after empty'ing the jug&lt;br /&gt;
Doyle rolls up the ice box lid to see poor Paddy's mug&lt;br /&gt;
We stopped the clock so Mrs. Murphy couldn't tell the time&lt;br /&gt;
And at a quarter after two we argued it was nine &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Chorus &lt;br /&gt;
They stopped the hearse on George Street outside Sundance
Saloon&lt;br /&gt;
They all went in at half past eight and staggered out at noon&lt;br /&gt;
They went up to the graveyard, so holy and sublime&lt;br /&gt;
Found out when they got there, they'd left the corpse behind!
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Chorus &lt;br /&gt;
Oh the night that Paddy Murphy died, is a night I'll never
forget&lt;br /&gt;
Some of the boys got loaded drunk and they ain't been sober
yet;&lt;br /&gt;
As long as a bottle was passed around every man was feelin'
gay&lt;br /&gt;
O'Leary came with the bagpipes, some music for to play&lt;br /&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Benzonia, a small village in Benzie Co. Michigan, was settled in 1858 by a group of colonists led by the Rev. Charles E. Bailey from Oberlin, Ohio.  In 1863 a college was established and became Benzonia College, later becoming an academy until it closed in 1918.  Benzonia was the boyhood home of Bruce Catton, the Civil War historian, whose father was a teacher and principal at the Benzonia Academy.

The Benzie Area Historical Society is located in Benzonia in an historic church building.  The museum has an interesting collection of artifacts and is a great place to visit with free admission right off of US 31.  The Betsie Valley Trail for biking and hiking runs through Benzonia and the Betsie River is enjoyed by canoeists and kayakers.  In late summer and early fall, the salmon run  excites fishermen  who come from all over finding many access points to the Betsie in Benzonia.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;b&gt;The Turtle&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
by Jack Prelutsky&lt;br&gt;
The turtle's always been inclined to live within his shell.&lt;br&gt;
But why he cares to be confined, the turtle does not tell.&lt;br&gt;
 So if you wish to visit him in his domestic dome,&lt;br&gt;
 Just knock politely on his shell, you'll find the turtle home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Turtle Lake! It's a small, 40 acre lake with one boat
launch, which is a gravel-surfaced ramp suitable for medium-sized
and smaller boats only. It has 10 parking spaces. The cache is a
large plastic jar filled with turtle-themed goodies. (What did you
expect?) Enjoy yourself, and take your time - the turtle is not in
a hurry! Cache on.&lt;/p&gt;

The area was busy with anglers today, and we were amazed by their catches - some BIG fish (salmon?), too heavy to be carried even, and the anglers had to drag them along the trail to their vehicles.  (This left a somewhat pervasive fish odor throughout the woods.)  The seagulls were loud and crazy in the parking area, fighting for a chance to gobble up some of the fish eggs that were left behind on the ground.  The Priscillaandfriends family prefers catch-and-release (or even just point-and-click) fishing, but we definitely admired the patience of the anglers and the serene setting in which they had immersed themselves.  We suspect they had some delicious Sunday dinners at the end of the day.  The walk was just gorgeous, and we enjoyed visiting a little hillside stream and a GIGANTIC maple tree that must have been at least 250-300 years old.  TFTC!

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;How the Great Lakes were formed.&lt;br&gt;
About a billion years ago, a fracture in the earth running from
what is now Oklahoma to Lake Superior generated volcanic activity
that almost split North America. Over a period of 20 million years,
lava intermittently flowed from the fracture. This geomorphic age
created mountains covering the regions now known as northern
Wisconsin and Minnesota, and the Laurentian Mountains were formed
in eastern Canada. Over time these mountains eroded, while
occasional volcanic activity continued. Eventually the fracture
stabilized and, over time, the rock tilted down from north to
south.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The region went from fire to ice with the arrival of the glaciers,
which advanced and retreated several times over the last 5 million
years. During the periods of glaciation, giant sheets of ice flowed
across the land, leveling mountains and carving out massive
valleys. Where they encountered more resistant bedrock in the
north, only the overlying layers were removed. To the south, the
softer sandstones and shales were more affected. As the glaciers
melted and began receding, their leading edges left behind high
ridges, some of which can be seen today in the cliffs of Door
County, Wisconsin, and the Bruce Peninsula in Ontario. Huge lakes
formed between these ridges from the retreating ice fronts, and
continually changed over time as the ice sheet moved northward.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Since the retreat of the glaciers, water levels continued to
undergo dramatic fluctuations, some in the magnitude of hundreds of
feet. These extremes were caused by changing climates, crustal
rebound and natural opening and closing of outlet channels. Within
the last 1,000 years, evidence suggests that lake levels exceeded
the range of levels recorded since 1865 by an additional five feet
on lakes Michigan and Huron. Many dune formations-some hundreds of
feet thick-were established during glacial periods. The tops of
these dunes have been continuously sculpted by winds to form the
majestic structures now visible.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Today, rebounding of the earth's crust, erosion, and changes in
climate continue to alter the shapes and sizes of the Great Lakes.
As one of the youngest natural features on the North American
continent, the lakes remain a dynamic, evolving system.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Lake Michigan is the only Great Lake that is entirely with the
United States boundary. The lakes water level is more than 20 feet
below that of Lake Superior. Lakes Michigan and Huron are connected
by the deep Straits of Mackinac and are considered to be one lake
hydraulically with lake levels rising and falling together. It is
ranked second largest of the Great Lakes according to volume, is
the only Great Lake entirely within the United States. Averaging
279 feet deep, the lake reaches 925 feet at its deepest point. Lake
Michigan is approximately 118 miles wide and 307 miles long and
boasts more than 1,600 miles of shoreline, including many sandy
beaches.&lt;br&gt;
 Ecologically Lake Michigan has the longest residence time of all
the Great lakes at 99 years. This is by far the longest residence
time of any of the Great Lakes.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 On your visit here you will need to complete the following.&lt;br&gt;
1. From the posted location take a water sample in a clear jar with
a lid. You will want to use surface water for the sample. E-mail me
with the a sediment description.&lt;br&gt;
2. Visit N44 37.985 W086 14.900. At this location inspect the lake
bottom looking to the north. Describe at least one aspect of
glacial deposits viewed here.&lt;br&gt;
3. Because of the beauty of this area please post a picture of
yourself with the lighthouse in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Because of lake levels the posted co-ords are on the beach.
The distance to the water is a changing one so the co-ords only get
you close.&lt;/center&gt;

     trail.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;You can ride your bike or walk from the Leelanau Trail parking
lot at Cherry Bend for about a two mile round trip. Then park your
bike and enjoy the hike. For a much shorter walk, park at the De
Young Natural Area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trail is well marked and runs through mature Cedars for a
1/4 mile loop. A new fishing dock affords nice views of the lake
and wildlife, and an opportunity to fish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the Louis De Young family, the farmstead was sold to
the Leelanau Conservancy and is preserved for the public use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is an easy find if you use the hint. Make sure to do
the Mallard View cache on the bike trail which also runs through
the property .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;PB1HFQB - De Young Natural Area&lt;br /&gt;N 44° 48.563 W 085° 39.244&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PC1HFQB - Cherry Bend&lt;br /&gt;N 44° 47.626 W 085° 38.747&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

I was a bit disturbed to see that there are two surveillance cameras, one up in the trees looking at the dock and another behind a Plexiglas plate at the front of the barn.  What is that all about?

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Located on the shores of  Lake Michigan and the Betsie Bay, Frankfort has been an historic sailing port for over one hundred years.  There are a multitude of activities in the Frankfort area to participate in; swimming, salmon fishing, golfing, hang gliding, wind surfing, biking and hiking the Betsie Valley Trail, attending art festivals, plus all kind of winter activities.  Nearby are the Point Betsie Lighthouse, Sleeping Bear National Lakeshore, wineries, Crystal Mountain, the Art Legacy Park, Concerts at Interlochen and many other interesting places to visit.  This is an outstanding family vacation area!

One thing, Frankfort needs is more geocaches!  I am endeavoring to help improve this situation.  At ground zero, muggles abound, so stealth is necessary.  A quick park &amp; grab.   Bring a pen to sign a log and then take a stroll down Main St. and enjoy the shops and  restaurants.</groundspeak:long_description>

The Tale Continues…


Perquisite Reading: Bootleggers Shootout  GC1P1W4


	…. The Sheriffs Dept. quickly spread the word across the state, to be on the lookout for the two bootleggers, Tony and Louie. Both were aware of this and after a couple of days hiding in the woods near Frankfort, Tony decided that they would get on the car ferry in Elberta and get out of the state and over to Wisconsin. They purchased a ticket and put their car in line to be loaded onto the ferry. Just before boarding the ship, Tony remembered a pill bottle he hid years ago with some money in it that he didn’t want to give to his boss after a profitable bootlegging job. Surprised, it was still there, he emptied it out, except some business card someone gave him and a piece of paper.
	As was usual procedure, a ferry worker would walk by the vehicles and hang a hook with a rubber ball and number on it so they knew what vehicles to load. Soon the train cars and other vehicles were loaded onto the ship. Clyde, one of the workers, got into Tony’s car and noticed broken glass on the inside and what appeared to be holes on the outside body. Having been on the ship he never heard the news about the shootout so thought little about it and went on his way.
	Half way across Lake Michigan, Clyde went down below deck to check on the train cars to make sure they were all still fastened down tight to the rails. He walked by Tony and Louie’s car and thought twice about it and decided to tell the captain. Of course the captain heard the news and realized that they had the two suspects aboard the ship. He quickly sent word to the Manitowoc Harbor and requested the sheriffs be at the dock when he arrives. He then had Clyde show him the car, where he searched it and found some guns and shells that he took back up to the bridge.
	The rest of the trip went along as usual, until the ship backed up to the unloading ramp. Here the sheriffs were waiting and Tony and Louie could see them from up on deck. They knew something was up so he and Louie made their way to the lower deck and to the car. They jumped inside to get their guns but they were nowhere to be found. Clyde and another boat worker saw the bootleggers in the car and quickly closed the doors on them throwing a chain used to fasten down the trains over the car and across the doors. Clyde grabbed a crow bar and had it ready to swing at anyone trying to get out of the rear shot-out window. Trapped, Tony and Louie sat waiting for the sheriffs to arrive.
	The car ferry office sent word over to the Benzie sheriff’s Dept. that the two bootleggers were caught and were being sent back to Michigan for a hearing.
	Later that week, a citation was given to Clyde for his fast thinking and going beyond the call of duty. Tony and Louie were convicted and spent some time in the county jail. After their release they headed downstate and never made there way up north again.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The village of Elberta is located on the shores of Lake Michigan in Benzie Co. Michigan.  The village was founded in 1866 by George M. Cartwright, a native of Grand Blanc, Michigan.  He was a lumberman connected with the sales of lumber and the purchase of real estate.  In Elberta,  Cartwright found that a harbor was being planned by the federal government and he saw the potential for commercial growth of the area.  The first railroad was built in 1870 and in 1892 it became the Ann Arbor Railroad which operated the car ferries that crossed to ports along Lake Michigan shores.  Originally named South Frankfort, in 1911 the village was renamed Elberta, for the Elberta peach, a fruit widely grown in the area.

Elberta features lovely beaches surrounded by high bluffs and sand dunes.  There are marinas and charter fishing boats to enjoy the salmon fishing on Lake Michigan.  A Waterfront Park has been established on the former Ann Arbor Railroad lands with playgrounds and a weekly Farmers’ Market. The Green Point Dunes Nature Preserve, two miles south of Elberta, offers trails though forests and meadows to breathtaking views of Lake Michigan.  The Betsie Valley Trailhead located in Elberta brings visitors to the village where several interesting restaurants are located.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Wetlands are defined as a landform which has soil saturated with moisture either seasonally or permanently.  Wetlands are characterized by as having a water table that stands at or near the soil long enough each year to support hydrophytes or aquatic plant life.  Water in wetlands may be saltwater, freshwater, or brackish.  The soil may be partially or completely covered with water.  Wetlands typically include swamps, marshes, and bogs.  Wetlands serve as food, shelter, and as a habitat for hundreds of native animal species.

Michigan has lost 70% of it’s coastal wetlands in the past 100 years due to human activities.  As a result animals have lost their habitats and our lakes and streams have lost the buffer that helps cleans water as it moves from the mainland out to the bay and finally to the Great Lakes.  Wetlands also help to keep excess nutrients out of the Suttons Bay and Lake Michigan.  Inland runoff carries harmful substances that include: oil and gasoline from roads and streets, fertilizers and pesticides from lawns, mercury from coal burning plants, plus bacteria and disease causing organisms.  Gasoline evaporates into the air.  Oil and other chemicals attach to clay particles and sink to the bottom.  The fertilizers help the wetland plans to grow instead of causing excessive growth of algae in the bay and Lake Michigan.  Wetlands act as a buffer or filter for lakes, streams, and rivers.    They trap and store chemicals that are carried by runoff instead of them ending up in the bay or lake.  Bacteria may change some chemical into harmless substances.

The Great Lakes Watershed contains two different types of wetlands – coastal and inland.
Coastal wetlands include northern great lakes marsh, lake plain marsh, northern rich fen, river marsh, and drowned river mouth.  Inland wetlands include rich fen, bogs, swamps, and shrub thickets.

This wetlands is part of the Inland Seas Education Center in Suttons Bay, MI.  Inland Seas Education Association’s mission is to help people of all ages experience the science and spirit of the Great Lakes through ship-board and onshore education programs.  In 2006 they wanted to do their part to help treat runoff before it entered Suttons Bay and ultimately Lake Michigan.  Their plan was to restore the shoreline along the bay, treat pollutions before it entered the bay, and restore wetlands.  This wetlands location has been certified by the National Wildlife Federation as a Certified Wildlife Habit.  It provides the basic elements for wildlife to thrive which includes: food, water, cover, and a place to raise their young.  This particular wetlands sits right on the edge of Suttons Bay and was connected to the nearby Suttons Bay marsh in 2006 to further add an additional layer of filtration of runoff into Suttons Bay.

To log this earth cache:

Visit the Inland Seas Education Center in Suttons Bay.  Take a stroll through their wetlands.  There are visual aids through the walking path that explains how wetlands work.




1)	Using the signs answer the following questions – 
a.	How is the wetlands here connected to the Suttons Bay Marsh?  
b.	What function does the greenbelt of shrubs and trees along the shoreline provide?  
c.	What is the number one source of pollution flowing into the Grand Traverse Bay according to the Grand Traverse Bay Watershed Protection Plan?
d.	What does runoff hurt?
2)	Have your photo taken with you or your group with the wetlands behind you.
3)	Email me the answer to the questions for #1  using my profile.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The plaque in front of the rest rooms indicates that Suttons Bay was established by Mr and Mrs Sutton in 1854. That plaque, placed to commemorate a centennial celebration shades the history of this spot a bit. Harry Sutton did establish a station for the shipping of wood from this well protected and deep harbor in 1854, and did own the land together with his son-in-law.  They named their little settlement Suttonsburg. The village proper was laid out by a missionary priest Father Herbstrit who hoped to found a Catholic settlement which would include a church and a school. With hopes that exceeded reality he planned a college he tentatively named National University. It was to be the focal point of his town which he named Pleasantville City. The church and school survive.
By 1880, the village, now known as Suttons Bay, was home to more than 250 people and had daily stagecoach service to Traverse City and Northport. It was a bustling place with two hotels, a sawmill and a number of stores.
The cache is among the rocks between the rest rooms and the water.</groundspeak:long_description>

Oh, and watch out for muggles, this can sometimes be a high traffic area on a nice day. But hey, bring a frisbee! Bring your dog! Its a fun site...</groundspeak:long_description>

You will need lots of mosquito spray and some good hiking shoes or boots.  Area was logged in 2007 and there is lots of debris left from the logging. First to find will find geocoins and travel bugs to choose from to move to another cache.  Look for the Bendon sign where you will park on Rhodes Road.</groundspeak:long_description>

This geocache was brought to my attention as being in need of an owner maintenance visit, because the cache seems to be missing. The cache owner needs to check on this cache ASAP and either replace it or archive it, after picking up any remaining geo-litter. See the maintenance section of the Geocache Listing Guidelines

In the meantime, I'm temporarily disabling this listing. I've bookmarked this cache, and I will check back in two weeks or so to be sure that the maintenance has been done. If you are unable to perform maintenance in this time, please post a note here indicating your intentions, otherwise the cache may be archived.

Thank you,

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">A great circle navigation puzzle; &lt;b&gt;Cache is not at the above
coordinates&lt;/b&gt;
</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Ever since I was in the United States Air Force I have been
fascinated by flight and, in particular, the flight of high
performance and stealth aircraft. I had "top secret" clearance but
even that was not enough for me to be allowed to know if Area 51
really existed. Though the government won't confirm it, most of us
do believe that Area 51 does exist as a secret airbase in a corner
of Nevada where super secret flight activity occurs. I have some
old Air Force buddies who live near Tonapah who keep their eyes on
the skies for unusual activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I was called by one of these buddies who had sighted an
unusual aircraft heading NE at an extraordinary rate of speed.
Inexplicably (or perhaps not), it was transmitting unencrypted data
such that we were able to track it from its origin at &lt;b&gt;N
37&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; 18.5891', W 115&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; 38.0593'&lt;/b&gt; to where
the data transmission abruptly ceased at &lt;b&gt;N 33&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;
13.6883', W 25&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; 08.6636'&lt;/b&gt;. The aircraft's travel
conformed strictly to a route of great circle navigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;img src=
"http://img.groundspeak.com/cache/2050c491-f2be-48d4-b0e0-081c9cb172f1.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was fascinated because the flight path took this aircraft
directly over Traverse City. As you can see above, I took a photo
of the aircraft as it passed overhead. Below is as a map of the
flight path (as we knew it). Your guess is as good as mine as to
what this aircraft was really up to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;I have hidden a geocache&lt;/b&gt; directly beneath the flight path
where this aircraft had traveled &lt;b&gt;precisely 1/3&lt;/b&gt; of its total
distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=

     align="left"&gt;To locate this geocache, you will need to perform
     great circle navigation calculations. These are conveniently
     provided by Ed Williams in his &lt;a href=
     "http://williams.best.vwh.net/gccalc.htm"&gt;Great Circle
     Calculator&lt;/a&gt;. Great circle routes are the shortest routes of
     navigating between points on the surface of the earth. This is
     not entirely intuitive as we all know that the shortest
     distance between two points is a straight line. However, to
     travel a straight line between any two distant points on a
     spheroid body like the earth would involve digging a
     substantial tunnel! Great circles, on the other hand, involve
     arcs of circles lying vertically above such straight lines in
     a plane passing through the center of the earth. In most cases
     great circles have true courses that vary from point to point.
     GPS receivers provide great circle navigation. For a more
     thorough understanding of great circle navigation, see
     Williams' &lt;a href=
     "http://williams.best.vwh.net/avform.htm"&gt;Aviation
     Formulary&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The coordinates that introduce this webpage are not for the
cache itself.&lt;/b&gt; Instead, they are for a convenient parking area.
If you need some help, feel free to contact &lt;a href=
"mailto:whitard@yahoo.com"&gt;Whitard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the coordinates in hand this will be an easy find. Have
fun!&lt;/p&gt;

 Captain Kidd be a plunderer o' many things, He sailed th' Great
Lakes in search o' booty an' found plenty. He be a portly swabbie,
a man o' girth - admired by shipmates o' all shapes an' sizes.

     width="250" height="316" alt="Captain-Kidd2" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
     &lt;font size="1"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Captain William Kidd (c. 1645-1701) was one
     of the most notorious pirates in history. He sailed the coast
     of North America, the Caribbean, and the Indian Ocean,
     plundering ships. To this day, rumors persist that he left
     behind a great treasure...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Upon one o' his great ventures, he be captured. Captured by th' law
o' th' land, an' be sentenced t' be hung. He fought well, but alas,
be nay match fer th' soldiers that surrounded th' lad's. Whist
captured he formulated a plan t' eat an' eat an' eat until he be
too big t' hang. &lt;br /&gt;
 Th' law thought differently, an' tried t' hang th' lad's none th'
less. Upon his hangin'... th' rope broke, ... an' Kidd laughed in
th' face o' his captures. &lt;br /&gt;
His captures, embarrased, intervened an' concluded that he would be
buried alive WI' his bountiful booty that he cherished so. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 That be th' last o' Captain Kidd o' th' Great Lakes. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;and in th' last words of Kidd himself...a
farewell speech of sorts&lt;br /&gt;
 My name was Captain Kidd, when I sail'd, when I sail'd, And so
wickedly I did, God's laws I did forbid, When I sail'd, when I
sail'd. I roam'd from sound to sound, And many a ship I found, And
then I sunk or burn'd, When I sail'd. I murder'd William Moore, And
laid him in his gore, Not many leagues from shore, When I sail'd.
Farewell to young and old, All jolly seamen bold, You're welcome to
my gold, For I must die, I must die. Farewell to Lunnon town, The
pretty girls all round, No pardon can be found, and I must die, I
must die, Farewell, for I must die. Then to eternity, in hideous
misery, I must lie, I must lie.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
However... his booty be nerechallenged, an' nerefound ye be seein'.
for Kidd had a final yo ho ho as his booty lay wi' th' lad's, kept
in a chest o' secrets. &lt;br /&gt;

A beautiful walk with the dog and the cache is getting skimpy.  Thanks to all who have logged their visits.  I was the only hunter in the woods tonight and saw no signs of any muzzle loader's in the area.  Get out of the house and take a nice walk this weekend.

The Cache is a green ammo box.  The contents of the box are as follows: two fifty dollar bills, a glitter pen, a Gibson sticker that I picked up at a trade show in Vegas.  The ammo box is fairly easy to spot, but the terrain is very steep and sandy.

PS.  don't get your cars stuck in the soft sand, i've been there before, its not fun

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">:D  It was such a beautiful day!  Could clearly see Arcadia Bluffs to the South, the Frankfort North Lighthouse and beyond to the Betsie Pte. area. This is our favorite area of Michigan and visit it many times throughout the year.  We have been visiting the Benzie County area for about 20 years now and can always find interesting things to explore.

This was find #5 of the day.  We made the earlier finds of the day with Cookie Crumb 1&amp;2; they opted to wait this one out on the beach.  It was quite the climb, but once to the top the cache was easy to find.  We examined the contents of the cache added a 2009 Penny.  SL  Took a plastic monkey.  TFTC!!</groundspeak:text>

&lt;p&gt;While enjoying coffee and conversation in a restaurant near the
above coordinates, we noticed an envelope lying on the floor. It
bore no return address but it had a cancelled stamp. An address
label was addressed to;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Northern Michigan Geocachers&lt;br&gt;
106 W Grandview Parkway&lt;br&gt;
Traverse City Michigan 49685&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That address caught our eye but we realized that there is no
longer a structure at 106. Where had the envelope come from? How
had it been delivered? How had it gotten here in the resturant? The
mystery deepened when we turned it over and saw these cryptic
markings written in pencil on the back;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Brush Script MT" size="6" color="red"&gt;A 44° noprq

&lt;p&gt;We could tell that this was some kind of code. Being experienced
Geocachers, we instantly thought we recognized part of it but the
rest had us stumped. By our third cup of coffee we experienced a
flash of insight. We used our lap top to access the internet and
with just a little bit of searching, solved the puzzle. We plugged
the coordinates into our GPS and soon found an ammo can in a nearby
park.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charles Whitard Sweasey (1837-1917) was my great-grandfather.
During the Civil War he served as a private in Company K, 98th Ohio
Volunteer Infantry. He took active part in the battles of Reseca,
Rome, Dallas, Kennesaw Mountain, Peach Tree Creek, Buzzard Roost,
and the Siege of Atlanta. He and the 98th continued on the March to
the Sea and the Carolinas campaign. He was under fire several times
in addition when he was not in any general engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This geocache is dedicated to my great-grandfather and all the
other veterans of the Civil War, both North and South. To find the
cache, you will have to solve the puzzle below. The cache is on
public land, and there is no need to go onto private property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Good luck!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Had to sneak up on it  due to a  tent  in the area near the coordinates, but no one seemed to be around.  Found the cache without a problem at the calculated coordinates. It was in good shape, I left “Strut” a tiny beanie baby chicken, A Hawaiian sandal key fob we brought from Honolulu and signature card.  Thanks for the challenge and the cache.</groundspeak:text>

Spent sometime looking and just could not see it. Is it due to all the leaves that have fallen recently? Was it just us not looking in the right place? Who knows. I know see that it is marked as being winter friendly so that does narrow down a few places we looked that we more than likely did not have to. I will be back.  Is this a winter friendly cache?

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">This is on a slight incline, but all paved area. HOWEVER, Please park in the park next to cache site. Elmwood Park- using the walking bridge to walk to the site. There are two signs that will give you the information that you need! I prefer that you have your picture with the one so that the bay is behind you but I won't get too picky.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">A watershed is another word for a basin. A watershed is a region of land where water drains downhill into a specified body of water, such as a river, lake, sea, ocean or wetland. A watershed includes both the waterway and the land that drains to it. Each watershed is separated topographically by a ridge, hill or mountain. A watershed is like a funnel - collecting all the water within the drainage area and channeling it into a waterway.When it rains or snow melts, there are many paths the water can take. It can soak into the soil and become groundwater, or enter a storm drain which then flows to a stream, lake, river or, in our case, the Grand Traverse Bay.

Grand Traverse Bay is a nearly pristine bay of Lake Michigan located on the northwest coast of Michigan's lower peninsula. The Bay's watershed encompasses 973 square miles and covers major portions of 4 counties: Grand Traverse, Antrim, Leelanau, and Kalkaska. Minor portions of the watershed are found in Charlevoix and Otsego counties.

The Grand Traverse Bay Watershed consists of the following major drainage basins:
Elk River Chain of Lakes 
Boardman River 
Mitchell Creek 
Acme Creek 
Ptobego Creek 
Yuba Creek 
East Bay shoreline 
West Bay shoreline 
Old Mission Peninsula

Everyday habits of the residents and visitors have a impact on the bay. 


1. To log this cache you must go to the listed coords and have your picture taken with your GPS in hand  post your picture with your log.

2. Read the sign. I need you to email me three things that you can do to help insure the safety of the water that we use. 

3. Using the information on the sign, calculate how many square miles the water shed covers? 

4. Look around. What type of topographic features make this area a prime drainage area. Looking east is a special type of land mass. Why is it important for people living on this land mass to know the geologic features of the area?



Unless you would like confirmation of a job well done and specifically ask for a confirmation email, if you are right you won't hear from me. If you are wrong...well..I will let you know!</groundspeak:long_description>

Throughout the hills and valleys of the Old Mission Peninsula, are over 500,000 cherry trees... making Traverse City the cherry capital of the world.

Each year, in early July, the National Cherry Festival attracts up to a half million visitors from all over the world.

The pristine waters of East and West Bay support sail and power boating, game fishing, water skiing, jet skiing, parasailing, diving around ship wrecks, and of course some of the best swimming available. If it's done on the water, it's done here.

Whether you're looking for snowmobiling, snowshoeing, downhill or cross-country skiing or snow-tubing northern Michigan is the best in the Midwest.

Nothing is more beautiful than Michigan in the wintertime.

On shore, you'll find many hotels located on or near the sandy beaches, plenty of shopping downtown, more great shopping at the Grand Traverse Mall and outlet stores.

The historic Park Place Hotel is located in the heart of downtown.

Traverse City has beautiful rolling bluffs that overlook the twin bays along the Old Mission Peninsula.

I discovered this location by accident and decided to share it with  fellow cachers.

There is no need to leave the public Right of Way to view this.

Watch out for airplanes!

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">As I was leaving town I called home to see if there was anything I
should get on the way home. I was told to “Pick up something for
Dinner”. I drove to the store, grabbed a cart and began
shopping.&lt;br&gt;
The problem is that when I’m in a store unescorted, and wandering
up and down the aisles, I tend to pick up a lot of things that
catch my eye and often forget what it was I went in for in the
first place. 
&lt;p&gt;At the check out, I watched the following items go through the
scanner;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a 20 pound box of Scoop Away,&lt;br&gt;
a package of plastic knives, forks and spoons,&lt;br&gt;
a large bag of Oreo cookies,&lt;br&gt;
a ½ gallon of Country Fresh chocolate milk,&lt;br&gt;
900 grams of tricolor cous cous,&lt;br&gt;
a get well card,&lt;br&gt;
a 1 pound carton of Michigan Brand cottage cheese,&lt;br&gt;
a 1 pound bottle of propane,&lt;br&gt;
a pack of paper plates,&lt;br&gt;
an 8 ounce jar of clam juice,&lt;br&gt;
a dozen eggs&lt;br&gt;
a 13.5 ounce can of Popeye spinach,&lt;br&gt;
a 10 ½ ounce can of Batman soup,&lt;br&gt;
a 1 pound jar of Ma Cohen’s herring in wine sauce,&lt;br&gt;
a 13 ¾ ounce jar of artichoke hearts,&lt;br&gt;
a 7 ounce box of Win Schuler’s chips,&lt;br&gt;
3.2 pounds of frozen buffalo tongue,&lt;br&gt;
a 25 ounce jar of Emeril’s Vodka Sauce,&lt;br&gt;
a 12 ounce jar of Liquid Maalox,&lt;br&gt;
a 5-ounce bottle of Dave’s Crazy Caribbean sauce,&lt;br&gt;
and an Edwards frozen Turtle Pie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I paid the cashier and picked up my grocery bags, I realized
that I could go just across the street and find a cache.&lt;/p&gt;
In the event you should have a problem finding the items on my
list, if you could please let us know what products are missing, we
will check and make changes as necessary. We want to keep this
cache active because we think it's interesting and they aren't
being approved anymore.

With a little help of a correction of 1 number, found this one this afternoon.  Got dropped off at the wrong spot.  Bushwacked my way through, past a few tents, through the thorny bushes, soaked the pants above my knees from the recent rain, and made my way to the hiding spot.  Located the cache this time though.  After finding it and seeing where it was, I'd have been better off going back to the store first.  TFTC SL TNLN

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">We are in the TC area this week and I managed to get out and get a few of the caches I still have not got to around here. I had given this one a go around Christmas time and managed to get out and look for it in a lot of snow.  Found out I was also looking in the wrong place.  It is surprising how far off 1 number can put you.  Today turned out to be a hole lot easier to get the cache.  Found it at 1:50pm for my 3rd find of the day.  TNLN.  Thanks for the cache!.

As I have done most of the caches in this area finding one that is winter friendly is a problem.  So I figured I would tackle this one today.  Did my shopping and got a set of coords.  So off I go to see if I can find it.  I made it to withing a few feet without to much trouble.  Then I find almost waist high snow.  I looked as much as I could.  But without any luck.  So now I am questioning my shopping ability and am I searching in the right place or not.  As if nothing else, I will be back for another look when there is less snow.  Goldfinch</groundspeak:text>

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This cache is placed in what is now known as the Grand Traverse
Commons. Built in 1885, it was first known as the Northern Michigan
Asylum. The hospital’s original theme was "beauty is therapy." The
hospitals first superintendent, Dr. James Decker Munson, felt that
if people were surrounded by beauty and tranquility, a lot of their
mental problems would cease to exist. 
&lt;p&gt;When we were growing up it was called "The Asylum" or "The State
Hospital" by the adults, to the smart mouthed kids it was "The 11th
Street College".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The institution was closed in 1989 and the buildings and grounds
began to decay. Ownership was passed by the State to the County,
the City of Traverse City, and Garfield Township. After some false
starts, reconstruction and maintenance of the buildings and 450
acres of grounds was given to the Minervini Group. Now called "The
Village" it is definitely a work in progress. At the time this
cache was placed, it is home to more than 60 businesses and
numerous condo housing units.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We picked The Cedar Cathedral Trail for this cache because of
the name. It is the trail with the green markers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4" face="Times" color="red"&gt;It is not necessary to
jump through the sticker/pamphlet hoops to log this
cache.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got the idea for our Trekking Traverse Trails series from a
similar series in Florida. As a reward for the first 50 who wish
one and who complete the series, we have created a Path Tag on
which is the Traverse City logo. To acquire a tag, stop at the
Traverse City Visitors Center(
&lt;a href="http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=70e9c579-f72c-44c7-a0c3-b06d5830fd3b"&gt;
GC17HZ4&lt;/a&gt;), and pick up a free Trekking Traverse Trails
brochure.&lt;br /&gt;
In each cache container you will find a sticker for that cache.
Paste each of the ten stickers in the brochure, mail it in, and we

If the name is unfamiliar, you can google it for a picture.  The cache is near the Copper Ridge medical center off W. Silver Lake Rd. in Traverse City.  As you enter stay to the right of building D and park in the far lot below the uncompleted concrete walls.  Parking coordinates are N 44 44.845, W 085 39.289.At the end of the lot is a 3-way trail junction.  Take the narrow uphill trail with exposed tree roots.  After a short walk there is another junction.  Stay to the right and you are almost there.  The cache is a plastic jar with screw-on lid.  From up here you will have a fine view of the battle if the Merrimack should appear.  The original cache was stolen by marauding muggles, so we have relocated it.  Use the same coordinates and when you reach that spot on the trail, start searching uphill.</groundspeak:long_description>

Glad that we did, as the area was very scenic with lots of colors still and the BIG old birch trees scattered around the property. [^]  Found the first 2 stages easily enough, but were stumped at #3 despite checking that place at least twice (guess our eyes aren't what they used to be [:P]) until reading the hint (tricky).

What a delightful little walk this is.  I was solo and had the reserve to myself today.  Gecko Grandma stayed at our lodging in Leland to rest after our outing to Northport and Grand Traverse Lighthouse where we spent all morning and part of the afternoon.  I loved the variety and solitude of this forest and dune terrain.  The intermediate waypoints were all relatively straightforward and I found myself at the cache site somewhat more quickly than I anticipated.  TNSL.  Left a light &amp; dark green lizard and the Sniper Geocoin, which I picked up two weeks ago in Vancouver, British Columbia.  It wants to return to Canada.  After rehiding the container and returning to the trailhead, I drove over to Christmas Cove to walk the shoreline and look for a Petoskey Stone as a memento of our trip.

Thanks for the hide.

Wherigo is a new way of utilizing GPS technology to play games,
take tours, and yes geocache. Visit
&lt;a href="http://www.wherigo.com" target="_blank"&gt;Wherigo.com&lt;/a&gt; to
learn more about this new software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do I need special equipment?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Yes! To find this cache the proper way and to truly experience the
hunt the way it was meant to be experienced, you will need two
things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Wherigo Player&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The "Historic Traverse City" cartridge&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

alt="Garmin Colorado" width="59" height="124" /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width="80%"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 
&lt;p align="left"&gt;The Wherigo Player comes pre-installed on the
Garmin Colorado and Garmin Oregon series GPS units. A version of
the player is available for download for use by GPS enabled Pocket
PC devices. Click "Download Player" to get the PPC version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.wherigo.com/player/download.aspx"

     align="top" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Once you have the Player ready to go, you will need
to download the cartridge for this cache. Click "Download
Cartridge" to get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Setting:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This Wherigo Geocache will take you to a few historic and
interesting places in this favorite Northern Michigan gem of ours.
We have vacationed in Traverse City for over 11 years now - several
times a year at that. You will have the opportunity to visit 5
historic and interesting sites (or zones in Wherigo terminology) in
Traverse City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Experience:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This Wherigo experience should be completed easily. There is some
driving involved between several of the zones. Getting the final
will also require driving and walking to the location. This
cartridge was designed to demonstrate some of the basic
functionality of Wherigo and how it can be used for geocaching. At
each zone you will be interacting with the founder of Traverse City
- Capt. Boardman. Capt. Boardman will be asking you questions about
each spot and in order for you to continue - you must correctly
answer the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This originally was my sixth Wherigo cache however I've had it
saved in the queue for well over a year now. The cartridge was
completed and tested in October of 2008. This cartidge can not be
completed by walking (well unless you want to do a lot of it -
which could be a good thing) but it will be a long walk in between
most of the zones. After you have visited each of the 5 zones and
answered all of the questions correctly you will be given the
coordinates to the parking location. &lt;i&gt;At the parking location you
will be given one last question. That question will have a slight
twist to it.&lt;/i&gt; Some where along the way you will have seen the
information that you need to get the coordinates for the final. I
would recommend taking notes or photos to assist you in answering
this question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is logging my result any different for this
cache?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Logging your results here on geocaching.com is no different than
any other cache (and you get a new icon on your profile page if you
have not done a Wherigo cache previously so no changes
there).&lt;img src="http://www.geocaching.com/images/WptTypes/wherigo_72.gif"
     alt="Icon" width="40" height="40" align="top" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Unlocking the cartridge on Whereigo.com is not required, but it
would be greatly appreciated. After you've completed the cartridge
you should see a "Historic Traverse City.gws" file on your device.
On your Garmin Colorado, you will find it in the Wherigo/Saves
directory. You can upload this file to Wherigo.com and it will
"Unlock" it, giving you full credit for completing the cartridge
(on the Wherigo site too). It will also help track the number of
completions for this cartridge. Again not required, but I would
really appreciate it if you did. You may also complete the
cartridge by visiting the cartridge page and &lt;strong&gt;Write a
Log.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hints for this Cache:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You may have to wander around in the zones to find required
information. The needed information could be on plaques, historical
markers, signs, etc. Once again - Pay very close attention to
everything you see as there will be a twist at the end to give you
one final challenge. If you paid sufficient attention - you will
have the answer. You may wish to take notes, photos, etc. to help
succesfully complete this challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logging requirements:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Once you successfully complete the cartridge - it will give you a
completion code. Please email me that code. This is a requirement
allowable by Groundspeak. No logs will be accepted without it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="red"&gt;Please note - the development and player
software is still in alpha stage and you may experience issues
running it.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

We had a great time cruising around Traverse City and then heading out to the final. We crossed a few wires here and there, but managed to come up with the find in time to head home for a great meal. Thanks for the well done whereigo and Merry Christmas! Congrats to fins&amp;feathers and Goldfinch for their milestones!</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Out with the crew. It has been a christmas tradition to go out and grab some caches on Christmas Eve. I think Fins&amp;Feathers was supposed to get some shopping done, but he came with us instead. I am not going to blame spelling error or error of information, let's just call it mixed signals for not getting the answer perfect. I missed the pop up code for some reason. But we were all there, Vante, Fins&amp;Feathers, War hammer (unregistered) and goldfinch. 
Special note: We were second to find. Vante insisted on doing a good deed and helping a guy out of the ditch, who hada beer unopened in his car cup holder! 
This is 700 find for fins&amp;feathers and 8400 for Goldfinch.

We are up in the area for the holidays and I wanted to get this cache as a milestone.  So I talked Sammy Pants into taking me out, (did not take much).  We had a large crew of cachers; Sammy Pants, Vante, fins&amp;feathers, war hammer and myself.  As I was raised in this area and spend a lot of time here I know where we were going from stop to stop.  Everything seemed to work fairly well for us.  We got close to the end and did have a problem and gave the owner a call.  He confirmed that we were using the correct answer, I guess we must have had a spelling error.  When we got to the final it was a short search for us to come up with the container.  Thanks Conman for the nicely done cache.

It took us the better part of the afternoon to complete and I think our next one should go faster. We had a great time on a perfect December day finding all the places to go. We took a pathtag and gold dollar and left a geogem + sig card. Thanks Conman for the very interesting TC cache!</groundspeak:text>

have to go for a half mile stroll.
</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">   &lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;img src=

&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Traverse City State Psychiatric
Hospital&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The grounds and walls of the old Traverse City State Psychiatric
Hospital doubtless would have many stories to tell if they could
talk. Probably mainly forgotten, many of these stories likely would
be sad and poignant. Despite the passage of time some stories are
remembered and, in fact, are happy ones. This cache remembers such
stories of two state hospital residents, one living and one dead,
who are memorialized on the grounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To "unlock" the secret of this cache, you will need to gather
data from markers about these two residents. These
markers/memorials are located within a short walking distance
nearby on Red and Silver Streets. Solving the puzzle will require
multiplying the age at death of the deceased individual (ignore
fractions of years) by the height in feet of the living
individual:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;Age(yrs) of deceased individual X Height(ft) of
living individual = puzzle clue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The coordinates listed above are close to, but not precisely
at, the cache.&lt;/b&gt; The cache is about sixty feet away and is
clearly visible from the starting point. The cache is on the
opposite side of the street from nearby structures, is small, and
will only accomodate small geotrade items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have fun!&lt;/p&gt;

Since the road there is quiet narrow, we were blocking it's progress and so had to drive 100 yards or so down to a wide spot for him to pass.  After returning to the site, the container was uncovered at 2:05 after rechecking a previously searched area.  Doubt a wheelchair could acess this "1".

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I rode up to Traverse City today with Goldfinch to deliver a lawn tractor to his inlaws and we cached along the way.  His brother in law, Fins&amp;Feathers has a boat and was kind enough to offer to take us out to this one.  We had just got done doing the 2 caches on Power Island, which took us longer than we thought they would.  The sun had already gone down behind the hills and I seriously wondered if we'd be able to locate the cache.  It turned out to be no problem at all and we had it in the boat at 815pm.  All 3 of us were curious how you could tape something to a rock underwater, but now we know.  I took the 5 Peso coin and exchanged it for a 25¢.   Thanks for a unique cache.</groundspeak:text>

Had asked Homebru to join my on the trip.  fins&amp;feathers was so kind to take us out in his boat to get this one tonight.  It was almost getting to dark but we still managed to find it.  Found it as my 16 find of the day.  Thanks dogbreath49684 for putting out the cache!

Well, the retiree retrieval response duo headed out this morning with all the necessary equipment to log this cache.  We found the location with little problem, however the last part was obviously up for grabs.  I lost the toss of the coin, so into the water I went ... but, at least that did give me first finder's claim.

Thanks for a fun cache hunt.

From an article by Mike Norton

Originally known as Asylum Creek, its name was changed sometime in the early 20th century to commemorate an annual children’s fishing contest that used to be held here. The fishing declined severely in the Sixties and Seventies, mainly because of sediment washing in from upstream, but today it’s recovering nicely. It’s hard to believe such a wild place exists just a few blocks from downtown Traverse City, but that’s one of the wonderful things about this town.</groundspeak:long_description>

those who have been wounded or killed while serving on or after
April 5, 1917 with the U.S. military. The National Purple Heart
Hall of Honor is located in New Windsor, New York. The original
idea for the Purple Heart (the Badge of Military Merit) is the
oldest symbol and award that is still given to members of the U.S.
military, surpassed in history only by the long obsolete Fidelity

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Godfried Franke bought 40 acres of land for $700 in 1879. He then built a water driven mill which was used for a variety of purposes.  One use was for early electrical power. Jerry Oleson then purchased the land in 1931 for $1,200. He added many more acres and used it for farming.  In 1956 he started to raise buffalo.  At this time he had 3! Since then the buffalo herds have grown and have been moved to several surrounding farms as well as one in the Upper Peninsula.  One herd still makes its home up and over the hill from here!

This should be an easy cache for all to find. There are trinkets for kids of all ages to trade, but, sadly, none for the buffalo!  Have fun and good luck.</groundspeak:long_description>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">A very nice diversion from the nearby shopping. Once we completed our 'list' we took a nice walk and seeing the area around ground zero I 'knew' where it would be. The GPSr was still pointing 60ft away however, so we spent a lot of time searching for a wild goose. After a while we gave up on the GPSr and started searching with our geo-hearts. Despite seeing her search there just minutes before, I went back over her tracks and scoffed at the semi-obvious spot. I guess it wasn't obvious because it can really only be seen from the right angle, but it was hidden exactly how we had initially expected. Well done. Thanks for bringing us to this place, nearby several other places that we have recently frequented, but never would have known to step off the beaten path onto this much more interesting path.</groundspeak:text>

We made our way along the boardwalk, viewed the buffalo on top of the hill, then saw what we must assume to be lunkers. That is a new term for us, thanks for sharing the history of the area. Right around ground zero looks to be a construction zone complete with orange fencing and recent large landscaping equipment evidence everywhere. We spent about 15 minutes looking around and around with no luck, then the cold got the better of us and we headed back to the car.

the children's museum (coordinates at the top of this page). Leaf
cover could make finding the cache a little more difficult in
season.&lt;/p&gt;

The Seuss Positioning System receiver probably comes with a comprehensive set of detailed instructions for its use, but being a guy it is strictly forbidden to read anything at all that comes with a product that might give a hint of direction on how to use it.
So, I printed off the cache page and stared at it for a long time before I got a shadowy idea of how things might work pieced together in the back of my mind. Had to have the Teacher help gather up some research material and started pouring over the documents to see if I could put things into place. After some head scratching and guesstimating I came up with a possible answer. It was one of my solutions where I look at it and say "Hmmm, maybe, but then again, maybe not". I played around with things a while longer but couldn't find any better way to make things work so I made a note of the answer and filed it away until I could make a trip up north.

Today was to be the test of how well the SPS worked and to see if I had figured out how to use it correctly. I had done several caches in the area and been on a lot of the trails here, or at least all of the trails that went uphill, so I wasn't surprised to see where the GPS was heading. Nothing like caching this area on a day with record high temps. I picked up a handy branch for a walking stick and set about the journey to where I hoped the cache would be. All the way there I kept wondering if I had really figured things out correctly or not. Always lots of doubts but you have to go look to know for sure. I finally got in the general area then let the GPS settle a bit before checking the direction and distance. I took a look around and picked a likely place, then walked over and used the walking stick branch to poke around with and was immediately greeted with the unmistakable sound of a cache container being thumped! Sweet success in the highlands!!  I like the way that SPS receiver works! Spot on accuracy and colorful graphics. May just have to retire my Garmin and get one of those. [:D]

Many thanks for another creative and well done cache,

Many events are held here, including major parts of the National Cherry Festival, the Traverse City Film Festival and the Michigan Schooner Festival.

The Slowfyers Team visited the Schooner Festival yesterday and found this great place to hide our magnetic nanocache. In the movie "Titanic", there is a scene where Leonardo DiCaprio climbs up on the railing at the bow of the ship and shouts, "I'm the king of the world!" If you look around, you'll see some railing that maybe you could imagine to be at the bow of a ship. The nano's at waist level, stuck to the north side of a steel joint. There is no room to hide a pencil, so bring your own.  Enjoy! Coordinates are the average of three readings on two days.</groundspeak:long_description>

These roads are not maintained and a 4x4 vehicle may be needed in wet weather.  The cache is located within a few feet of the road and does not require bushwhacking.  While there is not hike to find the cache the drive is defiantly worth it.

While getting this cache you may want to check out the nearby Green Point Nature Preserve.</groundspeak:long_description>

We tried to bushwack back, and ended up the road of Haze Rd. and wandered back to the tracker we'd parked on. STILL no shrooms, so it was even more enjoyable to find SOMETHING, such as a cache, so TFTC, and singin', 'Over Hill, Over Dale' . . .

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">A fun mystery - virtual cache in Traverse City
</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;When it is lunchtime in Greenwich, England, it is time for
breakfast in Traverse City. It turns out this can help you find a
geocache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calculating longitude was a significant problem for mariners.
Only when consistently accurate clocks were invented was it
possible to calculate longitude accurately. A little explanation
might help with understanding this: The earth rotates about its
axis every 24 hours. Therefore, in one hour the earth rotates 360
degrees/24 = 15 degrees of longitude. A clock set to &lt;a href=
"http://wwp.greenwichmeantime.com/"&gt;Greenwich Mean Time&lt;/a&gt; (at the
Prime Meridian) can then be used to calulate longitude. For
example, if the sun is at its zenith at your location (ie, it is
noon) and the time in Greenwich is 3 pm, then your longitude is 3
hrs. x 15 degrees/hr. = W 045 degrees. If you would like to learn
more about the historical problem of calculating longitude click
&lt;a href=
"http://rubens.anu.edu.au/student.projects97/naval/home.htm"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;
or &lt;a href=
"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/longitude/find.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find this cache ignore the standard time zones. When it is
noon in Greenwich, it is 6hrs, 17mins, 32.143 seconds a.m. at this
geocache (time for breakfast!). To find this cache it is not
necessary to calculate latitude. It is (in standard format): N
44&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; 45.694.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;img src=
"http://img.groundspeak.com/cache/fd16519d-7f99-4831-a55e-99a350b4d4f0.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Time at geocache: 6hrs, 17mins, 32.143
secs&lt;br&gt;
Latitude of geocache: N 44&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; 45.694&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time, 6:17:32.143, represents local solar time. Until the
late 19th century keeping track of time could be bewildering as
each locale might have its own time based on the solar cycle. The
coming of the railroads required standardization which has led to
"standard time zones" as we know them today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also a &lt;b&gt;virtual&lt;/b&gt; geocache. There was no practical
way of leaving a physical cache at this location. The cache
features a large object on which is inscribed a variety of
information, part of which concerns time. To get credit for this
cache, you must email &lt;a href=
"mailto:whitard@yahoo.com"&gt;Whitard&lt;/a&gt; with the time period
inscribed on this object and the name of the object's manufacturer.
&lt;b&gt;The coordinates on the top of this webpage are not for the cache
itself. Instead, they are for a location in fairly close
proximity.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have fun with this math and navigation challenge!&lt;/p&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Found this with my wife Caching Chick and kids Team Hollis while heading home after spending a week and a half driving and vacationing through the Upper Peninsula for our "Pure Michigan" tour. After solving this earlier in the year and emailing the cache owner I have been looking forward to being able to find this cache.  We weren't planning on coming through Traverse City on the way home but made our way this bay because of a new Wherigo cache in Traverse City.  We grabbed that one and a few other puzzles I had solved.  After grabbing this one we planned on stopping in at one of my wife's favorite store - the Cherry Republic and saw that Friday Night Live was going on.  We had been to that a few years ago and my wife still talks about it.  So we made a change of plans and had a great time in downtown Traverse City enjoying the food, music, and the entertainment.  

Thanks for a great challenge of a puzzle - I really loved the this one!

Highlights include:

- 1870 miles including finding a cache in each UP county
- Saw what we believe to have been a bobcat crossing the road
- Visited the bear ranch and had a blast
- Going through the Soo Locks on a boat tour
- See underwater shipwrecks in Munising
- Seeing some very cool and beautiful waterfalls
- Visiting a copper mine 
- Camping with the whole family
- Kids seeing shooting stars for the very first time while camping
- Seeing some of the most beautiful places right here in our home state

quickly.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Discovering this cache will take you on a walk/bike/roller blade of
nearly 2 miles along the Traverse City waterfront. From its
inception until the construction of the Parkway in the 1950’s, the
city’s bay front was an industrial area of sawmills, factories and
railroad tracks interrupted by three small beach parks. The four
cherry canneries each dumped their waste water containing stems,
leaves, pulp, and pits into the bay or the river which carried them
into the bay. When there was a wind from the north, the waves
brought this material, as well as decayed sawdust stirred up by the
waves, onshore so that for swimmers the first 10 - 15 yards out
from the beach was a thick organic soup. Traverse City kids learned
the breast stroke at a young age. Finding the answers to the
questions will give you a taste of that and other tales of Traverse
City history. Obviously, the cache is not at the above coordinates.
The container will be found at the following location. N44 A.BCD,
W085 E.FGH. Stroll the TART (Traverse Area Recreational Trail) from
44 46.140, 85 38.000 to 45.900, 85 36.700 and find the answers to a
group of questions. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A ____ Add the number of local kids who were killed in the
Korean War to the maximum width of the bay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B ____ Count the number of benches on the east breakwater and
add the number located on the green channel marker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C ____ Enter the final digit in the year that the Mussleman's
store was removed from the waterfront.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D ____ Add the final digit of the year Traverse City’s first
steam powered sawmill began operation to the final digit of the
year in which Hanna and Lay liquidated their lumber operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E ____ Add the number of companies for which the Parsons
Corporation produced helicopter parts to the number on the red
channel marker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;F ____ Enter the final digit of the number of the Traverse City
Purple Heart Chapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;G ____ Add the digits on the Indian Tree Trail Marker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;H ____ Find the “Time to Let Go” plaque, Subtract the first
digit from the last.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;br&gt;&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.groundspeak.com/cache/c1560930-be2d-4081-8879-0b997b749fc6.jpg"&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;b&gt;World War II&lt;/b&gt; illumined and gave focus to lives as has seldom occurred before or since. Perhaps for no one was this more true than  the Traverse City High School Class of 1943. Though places such as Normandy, Bastogne, and Iwo Jima were as yet unheard of, the boys of the Class of 1943 knew that somewhere in their destinies such places lay.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;Apparently it was in that spirit of illumination and and focus that someone discharged the Civil War cannon on the Grand Traverse County Courthouse lawn on the eve of the Traverse City High School homecoming game of 1942. At that time the cannon was in its original carriage and could be pivoted and elevated.  A projectile arced over town and exploded to the west leaving a large crater. As can be imagined, this event caused a great uproar although fortunately no one was hurt. The perpetrators were never caught. Nonetheless,  it was known that several members of the class of 1943 were drilling regularly on weekends at Camp Grayling and had specific knowledge of artillery.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;After all these years I am now ready to come clean – it was me and my friends who discharged the cannon that night.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.groundspeak.com/cache/16ffdec6-ade1-49a3-aa98-f0ab0afbd810.jpg"&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;P&gt;I have now hidden a geocache at the spot where that shell impacted and exploded. To find the geocache, the finder will have to perform the necessary calculations based on these data: The cannon muzzle was elevated to an angle of 31.5 degrees and the projectile was propelled at an initial velocity of 184.025 meters per second. The cannon was fired at a bearing of 248.67 degrees. To determine location of the impact, ignore factors of wind, terrain, etc. After you have calculated distance, use your GPSr to project a waypoint or use Ed Williams' &lt;A HREF="http://williams.best.vwh.net/gccalc.htm"&gt;Great Circle Calculator&lt;/A&gt; to do so. (Cannon balls don't travel in great circles but in this instance they did.) This cache was inspired by the Cowspots'&lt;A HREF="http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=8a29c7ca-af76-4fc2-a418-cf5ec81f7ed1"&gt; Hole in One!&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cannon has since been placed on its brick and concrete mount at least in part to avoid a repeat of such shenanigans. With the perspective of years, I am sure that is a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">1105 hrs The wind (out of SW) was a bit brisker than anticipated this morning so the crossing was a bit bumpy especially across the opening between the north end of the island and the tip of the peninsula. We gave up on the notion of landing on the west side of the island and made our way to the little dock on the east side (well protected from the winds). It was quite helpful to meet the park ranger and receive a little trail map of the island. As previously mentioned I did mis-lead our little contingent on the South Lookout Trail. But we quickly returned to the main trail and made our way to the SW corner of the Island. The cache was quickly found at these coords:  N 44 51.574 W 85 35.002.  If you use the posted coords it's likely you won't find this one. [:(]   After SL and making our trades (L. signature woodedn nickel). We proceeded to make our way along the trail northward along the west shore of the Island. Thanks for placing this one. It combines all the best features of the game: boats, great hiking trails, and adventure in the outdoors! </groundspeak:text>

The winds picked up earlier than anticipated, but, with Moonrock611 at the helm, we arrived safe and sound on Power Island ready to trek to the two caches hidden there. A big thanks to the park ranger and his wife for their hospitality, map of the trails and permission to tie-up the boat at the station dock. After a slight deviation on the wrong trail extension and a brief map orientation refresher with our team leader (have to keep an eye on these Coast Guard guys when they go feet dry(on land) [:)] Sorry Captphil) we continued on to gz. We used the coords listed in another cachers logs, located the cache, and added a smiley to the found column. This find also checks another box for me with the "Fizzy Challenge". Signed the log and left one of my signature Captainwilly wooden nickels. Thank you for this great cache and and the fun this group of NCOG members experienced. [:)]

Usually the business would have a loading dock the trains would stop at and load or unload its cargo. Over time, these spurs were no longer needed and as you can see here, have grown over with trees and shrubs. 
The city is making a big effort to clean up this part of town by removing old railroad cars and trash,now it's starting to look a little better. Note: the switch is not the cache container!</groundspeak:long_description>

Power Island
Bowers Harbor, West Grand Traverse Bay, Traverse City • (231) 922-4818
Formerly known as Marion Island but recently renamed for philanthropist
Eugene Power of Ann Arbor, this is a 205-acre island nature preserve in West
Grand Traverse Bay just off Bower's Harbor. This island is one of the last
undeveloped Great Lakes islands in close proximity to an urban area. It is
filled with a beautiful stand of northern hardwoods, including beech, sugar
maple, basswood and red oak, as well as more than 250 plant species.
Wildlife includes red fox and bobcat who prey on such small mammals as the
meadow vole, woodland deer mouse and short-tailed shrew. Bird-watchers will
likely see the red-eyed vireo, American goldfinch, veery and bank and tree
swallow. Approximately 11 miles of hiking trails weave through the island's
interior. Due to Power Island's proximity to Traverse City, it is a popular
boating and picnicking destination. </groundspeak:long_description>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">1145 hrs This may be one of Michigan's best kept secrets!  The wind (out of SW) was a bit brisker than anticipated this morning so the crossing was a bit bumpy especially across the opening between the north end of the island and the tip of the peninsula. We gave up on the notion of landing on the west side of the island and made our way to the little dock on the east side (well protected from the winds). It was quite helpful to meet the park ranger and receive a little trail map of the island.  After logging the cache on the SW corner of the Island we proceeded to make our way along the trail northward along the west shore of the Island. It was a great hike with a marvelous group of caching friends. After SL and leaving our various trinkets like signature wooden nickels we took pictures and enjoyed the view and cool SW breezes. Almost a perfect day for an adventure of this sort  It combines all the best features of the game: boats, great hiking trails, and adventure in the outdoors!  I enjoyed the hike up to and along the ridge of the Island, returning to the boat docks. We left our donation, chatted with the park ranger and moonrock611 left with two of our contingent, while I remained behind with Printmaster1952 to catch the 2nd shuttle. The return trup was also quite bumpy and wet but we had rain slickers and managed to stay fairly dry. Thanks for keeping this oldie/goodie alive!</groundspeak:text>

The trip north was planned around finding the two oldest caches in Michigan with GC35 being the first. It's nice to see that these older caches are still active and being maintained. As TeamBobcats mentioned in his log, the Ohio Jasmer Challenge is one that I hope to complete in the near future, so visiting this one has been in the works for awhile. This cache also was a milestone for me personally, being my 1,800th cache find. Thanks for keeping this great cache active and for giving me an extra reason to visit this scenic island.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Once upon a time, long ago, there lived a poor, ugly servant named Sam.  He was a commoner who lived in the kingdom only to serve the king.

One day, while working in the palace gardens, he happened to chance upon the lovely Princess Angelina.  He fell in love instantly and made it his intention to win the young damsel’s heart.

He decided to seek counsel with the evil witch Esmeralda.  He asked Esmeralda for a love potion that would cast a spell upon the lovely princess.

The evil witch agreed to give the love potion to Sam, if he met her price.  She wanted his pet dog (a pug, of course) for herself.  Sam thought long and hard – well, not that long and hard. You see, Sam was a simple man, but he did love that dog.

Sam said he would meet her bargain, but she had to prove that she had the potion.  Esmeralda took him into the enchanted forest and showed him her potion which was stashed in a box at the base of an old magic maple tree.  Sam lied and told the evil witch that he would be back with the dog at noon the next day.

So, the next morning he got up early and raced to that magic maple tree.  He ran as fast as he could, but as he got closer to the magic tree, he noticed Esmeralda sleeping under the magic tree.  He was no more than 100 feet away, when suddenly he broke a tree branch and Esmeralda woke up.  She instantly saw thru his scheme.  Then, just as Sam had set his sights upon the magic tree and its treasure, she waved her magic wand and he disappeared in a puff of smoke.

The above coordinates are for his last known whereabouts.  If you can find Sam, perhaps he will lead you to Esmeralda’s magic stash.  Good luck, but be careful that you don’t wake the witch.

Fellow cachers, please do not disturb Sam's remains.  It is unnecessary to remove him and his placement is important to help others to find Esmeralda’s magic stash.

Were you waiting for a happy ending?  Well, how about this?  Princess Angelina married Prince Charming.  And Sam DID become a LEGEND.  I think he’s happy, too.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This cache is near the NMC Maritime Academy and the T/S State of Michigan.

The Maritime Academy is home to the 224-foot former Navy submarine surveillance ship Persistent, which is now the T/S State of Michigan. While there stroll out on the pier to see the ship.

The vessel is relatively new, having been built in 1986 as part of a series of 18 Stalwart-class T-AGOS vessels designed to tow highly sensitive sonar arrays for the tracking of Soviet submarines. As the Soviet threat diminished in the 1990's, the Navy decided to decommission the T-AGOS fleet, and in 1998 Persistent was transferred to the U.S. Coast Guard for primary use in drug interdiction.

While under Coast Guard ownership, the Persistent was overhauled and repowered, but eventually deemed too slow for offshore drug enforcement and made available to other government agencies. Working through the U.S. Maritime Administration, the Maritime Academy negotiated the transfer of the vessel to our harbor in Traverse City. The Training Ship supplements other training vessels and allows cadets to put into practice the theory and skill sets taught in the classroom.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Suttons Bay Township actually has a street named Lovers Lane. Where the short street meets Grand Traverse Bay there is a park dedicated to Vic Steimel who arranged the transfer of the property to the township thereby guaranteeing access to the public forever. Although at this time the park lacks a sandy beach and playground equipment, it is a very pleasant spot for a picnic or just to pause and enjoy the view of the water.</groundspeak:long_description>

My Great Great Grandfather owned about a 1/4 mile of lake front near here. We were able to locate his house about a mile down the road from here. And being Smith Rd. runs right near his house I am betting the Road was named for his family. It was so cool to find this ppark so near and area important to my family history. Lillypad made the grab on this one.

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">Walk along the TC waterfront from the "Shuffleboard Club" to
"Darrow's Beach", a little more than 2 miles. Combine this cache
with &lt;a href=
"http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=62e8fc63-af99-49f7-a894-adb789bb17cf"&gt;
GC1B878&lt;/a&gt; for a twofer.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">When we were kids, whenever you heard someone complain about the
size of their paycheck, someone would always chime in with “The
view of the Bay is half the pay”. Ironic because the view and
access then was much less than it is now. Historically, folks were
more interested in making a living than enjoying the Bay. The
waterfront was dominated by factories, warehouses, railroad sidings
and shipping piers. Looking for the Bay, one was much more likely
to see smokestacks and box cars than anything like the view we
enjoy today. 
&lt;p&gt;During the short summer season, most forms of in-town water
recreation were restricted to kids and the tourists. On the weekend
local residents were most likely to use their private clubs, their
cottages on the warmer inland lakes or, perhaps to gather up their
families for a steamer excursion out to Marion Island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were three small beaches downtown where the young would
congregate with the few tourists - Sunset, Clinch and Darrow’s.
Reaching Clinch and Darrow’s required crossing the railroad tracks
that ran along the waterfront. The rest of the beach front was
privately owned and closed to pedestrian traffic. That began to
change in the 1950’s with the removal of the tracks and the
construction of the parkway. Today, with the exception of the
Holiday Inn, the waterfront is publicly owned from the old
Shuffleboard Club, (today’s Senior Center) to the site of the
westernmost beach which was adjacent to Darrow’s Marina. (Near the
county line at M72)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This multi will lead you along the Traverse Area Recreational
Trail (TART) the length of the publicly owned waterfront. Although
we recommend that you walk the route, it is not necessary, there is
plentiful parking along the route. Please be careful entering,
exiting and crossing the Parkway.&lt;/p&gt;
Because all stages are in extremely high muggle areas, each is
marked with at least two tags. After the second or third find you
will become familiar with both of them. This knowledge will help
you find the Coy Chev container at the end of your walk. Please be
as inconspicuous as possible when retrieving and replacing the
stages. 
&lt;p&gt;As you travel to complete this cache, you will be on a spur
trail less than 100 yards from &lt;a href=
"http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=4ca94db4-201c-4b95-a966-d158dc6aea25"&gt;

Had to wear my blaze orange vest and hat due to gun deer season and there was a hunter's truck parked near “ where the road disappears”. We had heard the cache had a hole in, so we stop and picked up another container till the cache owner could redo it. When the cache was  found all seemed well. Both the cache and log were dry.

This is a dawn to dusk cache.  When entering this cache site, please be respectful.

Joyfield Township, a township in Benzie County, Michigan, was organized in 1868 when Benzie County was still a part of Grand Traverse County.  The Reverend Charles E.  Bailey, the founder of Benzonia, named the township ”Joyfield” for the Joy family who were early settlers of the area.  Arriving in 1863, the Reverend Amariah Joy and his son William A. Joy entered homesteads near what is now US 31 and Joyfield Road.  William, a Civil War soldier, who fought at the Battle of Shiloh, continued service to his community.  He served as postmaster of the Joyfield Post Office and as township supervisor.  William described his first cabin as an 8 by 10 ft. shanty with a bark roof, which leaked in rainy weather.  The family later moved into a larger log cabin which often was a stopping place for travelers going between Traverse City and Manistee on the main road linking these two towns.  Joyfield Township was well adapted to farming and growing fruit even to this day.</groundspeak:long_description>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Greetings,

While Geocaching.com would like to continue to hold the location for you, doing so blocks other cachers from placing caches in the area.  We feel that this cache has been down for a period of time exceeding what is reasonable for the area. The cache owner needs to check on this cache ASAP and either replace it or archive it, after picking up any geo-litter. See the maintenance section of the Geocache Listing Guidelines: http://www.geocaching.com/about/guidelines.aspx#maint

I've bookmarked this cache, and I will check back in a couple weeks to be sure that the maintenance has been done. If you are unable to maintain this cache or do not respond it may be archived

Thank you,

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The "OLD" Fair Grounds I wanted to get this cache going so will add
some Historical info. later. I do remember as a kid going to the
Fair via a hole in the fence which was really a ravine in the land
and the fence went straight across it leaving a crawl under hole. I
think the Fair knew about it because it was like a highway of kids
coming and going all day. Which was Great, because it allowed us to
buy some cotton candy with our .50 cents entry fee. How things have
changed! Oh, the track length is approx. 5150 feet. History of the
Grand Traverse Civic Center The site formerly called the
fairgrounds was purchased by Grand Traverse County from Howard and
Isabelle Whiting on May 1, 1912 for $10,000. Its use was primarily
for the Northwestern Michigan Fair. In 1962, it was considered
advisable, by some, to sell the property for private use. However,
public reaction was so great in opposition to this, that the idea
was dropped. The property was used by the Fair Association and
rentals for events such as Mexican dances, trailer conclaves (Tin
Can Tourists), teenage dances, Scout-o-rama, Little League
baseball, kennel shows, community bazaars and other community
events. In spite of these worthwhile projects, it was felt that
better use could be made of this valuable property, and the firm of
Johnson, Johnson and Roy were engaged to make a study of the
property for recreational use. On November 8, 1967, a resolution
was adopted by the Board of Supervisors to change the name County
Fairgrounds to Grand Traverse Civic Center. On March 20, 1969, an
agreement was signed with the Paul Easling Memorial Fund Committee
for the construction of the Easling Memorial Swimming Pool. The
year 1973 ended with the holding of the Northwest Michigan Fair at
this location. The master plan as presented by Johnson, Johnson and
Roy consisted of illuminated athletic fields, parking areas, access
and egress away from the main flow of traffic on East Front Street,
picnic sites, with the eventual addition of a conference center and
an exhibit park. In 1989, the County Board of Commissioners
authorized the building of the Howe Arena next to the Easling Pool.
It was financed through a bond issue of $80,000 by the County
Building Authority. A local group of hockey and ice-skating
enthusiasts, ICE (Involved Citizens Enterprises), donated $200,000
and Rotary Charities contributed a matching grant of $200,000.
Opening ceremonies took place in September of 1989.

Despite a wind-chill bringing us into the sub-Z’s, that didn’t keep us from a day of looking for cold cache.  Coords were a bit off (60’ ~).  I was caching with ‘kdnydnr’ who found this one a while back and confirmed that I was looking in the right place.  I then read the last few log entries and crossed the bridge and tried again.  Yep… There it was.  Figured someone thought their GPSr was better and moved it for the owner; some people!  Anyway, thought briefly about moving it back, but then I’d be in that “some people” category.  So I signed in and put it back where I found it.  Owner may want to confirm if this is where they want it.  Thanks for the hunt [:D].

Blaine Township is located in southwest Benzie County Michigan and has an interesting history.  In 1851 Harrison Averill arrived and bought land on Lower Herring Lake and on Herring Creek.  He built a sawmill that was water powered and he produced lumber.  Averill sent his lumber on rafts to the outlet where ships were waiting on Lake Michigan to take the lumber to Chicago.  Averill continued to run the sawmill for twelve or thirteen years when the property was sold.  It was said that Averill had a great dislike for Indians even though only a few Indians were living in the area.  A hunter and trapper, Joseph Oliver, finally settled in Frankfort with his Indian wife.  In 1852 Oliver’s wife died, and he asked Averill for lumber to make a coffin and for help making it.  Averill refused, even refusing to loan Oliver tools to use.  One of the mill hands heard the conversation, and he went to help Oliver make the coffin.  Averill upon hearing of the mill hand’s kindness promptly fired the worker.

In the early 1890s a town, Watervale, was inhabited on Lower Herring Lake.  Watervale was built by the Leo Hale Lumber Company in 1892 with a sawmill, a boarding house for the lumberjacks, and a general store with a post office.  There were eight houses for married workers and the town had a narrow gauge railroad running from Putney Corners to Lake Michigan.  When the lumber company went bankrupt, Watervale became a ghost town.  In 1917 Dr. Oscar Kraft bought the complete town to use as a summer vacation spot for his family of seven brothers and sisters.  In 1960, the present owners’ family purchased Watervale and continued running it as a family vacation retreat with outstanding facilities and activities.  Watervale is now on the Registry of Historic Places.

Today the main agricultural activities are fruit orchards, mainly cherry and apples are the main crops.  Beside Watervale, there are many interesting things to see.  Hiking through the woods to a sand dune, Old Baldy, a 300 foot dune, and then going on to swim in Lake Michigan.  Old Baldy is part of the preserve owned by the Grand Traverse Land Conservancy with fifteen miles of hiking and biking trails.  Old Baldy is the site of a geocache, GCWXXK.  Another interesting place in Blaine Township is the Mystery Spot at the corner of Putney and Joyfield Roads, where there is a virtual cache, GCGA2K.  The Upper Herring Nature Preserve has a two track trail to a boardwalk which goes through a marsh to several ponds.

Blaine Township is a wonderful place to visit with an interesting history, exquisite scenic beauty, and delightful places to visit.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;b&gt;I will say this is not a cache for all geocachers!&lt;/b&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;This cache is being places to mark my milestone of finding 400
geocaches.&lt;/b&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The cache is located off the Boardman Valley Trail as listed
in their brochures. The area is part of the Grand Traverse
Conservation District. They rate the trail as an "easy trail" as it
is mostly on level ground. There is parking available at either the
current YMCA or the Grand Traverse Conservation District Nature
Center on Cass. The trail will only take you part of the way to
this one. Eventually you will have to leave the trail and find the
way to the cache.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;You do not need to get your feet wet to find the cache, but
it could possible save some time....or.....maybe you have some
Gunner in ya, but I wouldn't recommend it.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;As always have fun in nature!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

My Nuvi wanted me to come at it from the east but I didn't feel like a swim. I approached from the south and walked the main trail until I was only 35 feet away. I had no hip boots so I backtracked until I could see the proper approach The beaver are sure having fun stocking up on winter food. Found the cache, signed the log and enjoyed the day.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">There are many ways to approach this cache, by land or by water. If travelling by land, we suggest parking in the lot @ N44° 32.042 &amp; W 086° 02.330.  We did the "loop-the-loop", and thus decided on the ratings. Please let us know if they are good. On the Invisi-Trail you better have Skeeter Killer, 'cause they are out in force! Also, you are likely to run into other joggers/hikers/people (2 &amp; 4 footed) so take care when exposing the cache itself. This cache is a green and kinda camo brown ammo box. It pretty well out of view, mostly covered with leaves, etc. You'll see when you get there. &lt;P&gt;
Our original inventory:&lt;P&gt;

Animal Items;&lt;ul&gt;
   - Tiny Dalmation Doggie &lt;br&gt;
   - The Bluebird of Happiness&lt;br&gt;
   - Kitten magnet&lt;br&gt;
   - Squirrel carving in wood&lt;br&gt;

   - Butterfly feeders&lt;br&gt;

Vegetable Items:&lt;ul&gt;
   - Snuff box (empty) with inlaid Flowers&lt;/ul&gt;

border="0" /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="black"&gt;Geology of the Grand Traverse
Bay region, including the Boardman River&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="black"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="blue"&gt;The Grand Traverse
Bay region has a rich and complex geologic history. During the last
glacial advance, glaciers carved deep valleys into the shale and
limestone bedrock and deposited enormous sediment accumulations
known as glacial till. Glacial till is the mixture of rocks,
boulders, and soil picked up by a moving glacier and carried along
the path of the ice advance. Glaciers deposit till along their
path: on the sides of the ice sheet, at the toe of the glacier when
it recedes, and across valley floors when the ice sheet melts.
Glacial till deposits are akin to the footprint of a glacier and
are used to track the movement of glaciers. Glacial till deposits
can be good sources of ground water, if they do not contain
significant amounts of impermeable clays. Some of the glacial till
deposits in the Grand Traverse region are as thick as 1,200 feet.
Sediment characteristics in the area vary widely, in some areas
changing from thick, lacustrine clay to a coarse-grained moraine
within a few hundred feet. Elevations range from a low of 484 feet
above sea level to a high of 1,543 feet above sea level. Some of
the highest and steepest sections in the area are located in the
headwater areas of the Elk River Chain of Lakes and Boardman
River.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

"0" /&gt;The Boardman River Dams&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="black"&gt;&lt;font color="blue"&gt;&lt;font color=
"black"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="green"&gt;One of the ways man can dramatically
change nature is by creating dams on natural rivers. Such is the
case of the Boardman River, where there are currently four dams
within the last ten vertical miles before the Boardman River
empties into the Grand Traverse Bay. This Earthcache is at the site
of the Sabin Pond dam, which is on the north end of the Sabin Pond
on the Boardman River. After much controversy, the decision has
been made to return the Boardman River to its natural state in this
area by removing this dam.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="black"&gt;&lt;font color="blue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color=
"green"&gt;Of the four remaining dams, three continue to produce
electrical power today. All three dams are operated by Traverse
City Light and Power (TCLP). Two of the dams are leased from Grand
Traverse County, the other is owned by the City of Traverse City.
Traverse City Light and Power has announced that they will cease
power generating activities at these sites because the operations
are no longer economically viable. As a result, decisions will need
to be made by the owners of the dams &amp;#8211; Grand Traverse County
and the City of Traverse City &amp;#8211; about what the fate of the
dams will be. Under this project, the Boardman could become the
site of one of the first system-wide, comprehensive rehabilitation
projects in Michigan built around the restoration of a more natural
hydrologic regime. This would be accomplished if decisions are made
to remove up to four dams. In that event, restoration of these
impoundments to riverine systems would occur and programs would be
designed and implemented involving the ecological, institutional,
educational and recreational factors that influence the
sustainability of the river
system.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Watershed&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="black"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="red"&gt;The Boardman River
watershed encompasses 287 square miles in the northwestern lower
peninsula of Michigan. The river flows through the cities of
Kalkaska and Traverse City and empties into West Grand Traverse
Bay. The Boardman contributes approximately one-third of the water
volume to the Bay, which was recognized in 1998 by the U.S. EPA as
one of the most pristine freshwater bays in the world. The Boardman
River is considered one of the top-ten trout streams in Michigan
with more than 36 of the system&amp;#8217;s 179 river miles designated
Blue Ribbon river sections. It is also a &amp;#8220;State Natural
River&amp;#8221; which provides additional protective zoning. The river
benefits from considerable public land ownership (approximately
50%) along the corridor. It has an exceptional brook and brown
trout fishery, and in the lower reaches, supports substantial runs
of migratory fish from Lake Michigan such as steelhead, salmon,
brown trout, and lake trout.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Future&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="black"&gt;&lt;font color="purple"&gt;Despite these
distinctions, the full potential of the river is limited by
historic and current activities. Originally known as the
&amp;#8220;Ottawa&amp;#8221; after the local band of Native Americans, the
river&amp;#8217;s name was changed in recognition of timber baron
Captain Harry Boardman who was in the area for three years
(1848-51), before selling his timber rights to the eventual real
timber barons of the area, Hanna &amp;amp; Lay. Like many rivers during
the mid to late-1800&amp;#8217;s the Boardman served as a conduit for
millions of logs during the height of the logging era. These
activities had the now familiar, but devastating impacts on river
habitat by incising the channels and removing in-stream debris that
provided structure and cover. These activities also helped drive
Michigan&amp;#8217;s native grayling fishery to extinction. In the late
1880&amp;#8217;s, five dams were constructed on the Boardman River,
including Boardman Dam in 1894, Union Street Dam in 1867, Sabin Dam
in 1906, Keystone Dam in 1908 and Brown Bridge Dam in 1921. In
September 1961, Keystone Dam washed out, nearly taking Boardman and
Sabin Dams as well. Over the years, several other smaller dams on
tributaries to the Boardman also failed, including Captain
Boardman&amp;#8217;s Mill Dam on Kid&amp;#8217;s Creek and a mill dam in
Mayfield on Swainston&amp;#8217;s Creek.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="purple"&gt;In April 2009, the decision was made to
remove three of the four dams, leaving only the Keystone dam to
deter sea lampreys from entering into the Boardman. Once the three
dams are removed, the only dam on the Boardman River will be the
Union Street dam on a river that forms in Kalkaska County and flows
westward before emptying into Lake Michigan. We&amp;#8217;ll see if
that ever happens once all of the special interest groups get
involved! DAM IT&amp;#8230; OR NOT???&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

following:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="green"&gt;&lt;font color="red"&gt;1. Post a picture of
yourself and/or GPS with your log.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="green"&gt;&lt;font color="red"&gt;2. Take an elevation
reading on the top of the dam and the bottom of the dam. What is
the change in elevation?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="green"&gt;&lt;font color="red"&gt;3. Glacial till is
evident at the surface in this area. Describe the primary size and
content (sand, gravel or boulders) of the glacier till that you see
along the banks and in the river bottom on the lower side of the
dam.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

We began as supporters of maintaining the dams to produce power but have gradually come to the opinion that the costs required to repair and maintain can never be recouped by the power generated. The loss of Keystone resulted in giving this area the only rated rapids below the bridge. Removing at least these two down stream dams might produce more for the area in tourism that they could as power sources. We look forward to seeing what the river looks like after it is restored.</groundspeak:text>

Finally a previous finder and local GR cacher confirmed my suspicion that I was starting to over complicate things, so I took a step back and this one showed itself to me.

What an awesome view we enjoyed from the area! This also lead us to a clue of another mystery that had been the talk of the day all during Thanksgiving. Double bonus! TFTC</groundspeak:text>

I was digging through by buddy's (gvsu4msu) profile - I found that he had found it and logged it but I had not!  Funny, I was with him and remember chatting about it as we were walking to it too.  Well, it turns out I had done it but forgot to get it logged.

Thanks for this cache and thanks for another smiley!

The location of the clue is N44 47.1702, W85 34.1743.  See the encripted clue for a hint.  Finding this white rock will lead you to the location of the cache.  It is a large tuperware container.  Please be sure to hide the container very well in it's spot after you find it.  Happy hiking!

We found it in the Betsie Trail Cache (GC1GMK7) and thought we should place it somewhere not too far away.  From the posted coordinates you will have a nice view of Lower Herring Lake and a feature known as "Boo Hoo".  This is a good spot to snap a photo, take a swim or just enjoy beautiful Benzie County.  There are several other caches in the area, including our "Wreck of the Marinette -- 1886" (GCP18T)</groundspeak:long_description>

They found racoon tracks and could tell by other markings that the curious little creature had dragged their treasure away!  Ever since they have been combing the forest in search of their childhood loot!

The cache is in a small clear plastic container with a screw on cap.  It is a little less than a foot long and around three inches wide.

Its original contents were:
Hot Wheels Car
Dinosaur
Nickelodeon Dog Tag
Two Dolls (a couple)
Fridge Magnet
Powerful Hard Drive Magnet
Marbles
Glass Stones
A&amp;W Mini Mug</groundspeak:long_description>
      <groundspeak:encoded_hints>From the trail not far within sight to be sure.  Off the ground but not high, it is hidden well.  In the place where a squirrel or racoon might dwell.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

Mr. Kihap thought so too.  Then we began hiking out to the cache.  Again, it seemed familiar.  When we actually found the cache, Mr. Kihap wondered why, as cold as it was, I was thumbing through the log.  Eureka!  We had found this cache in August, 2008, signed the log but never logged it on line.  Nice that we can find a cache twice,the second time in a foot of snow.  So we signed the log again and this time, for sure, I am logging it on line.  Whether in the summer or winter, this cache provides the finder with a nice hike in a nice area.

I searched for the history of this park, but could not find out anything about Graham and Greene:(</groundspeak:long_description>

We wandered around back in there some as our GPSr didn't want to reveal the secret without a struggle, but eventually the container was spotted at 1:00.  As previous cachers have reported, the container and its contents are wet.  The log was very soggy, so we didn't sign it, but left our Sig Cards as proof that we visited.  After logging our find we had a brief snack while enjoying the scenery and peacefulness this park provided.  Thanks for showing it to us.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">Park at the Grand Traverse County Public Services Building.(N44 43.538 W85 36.338) The cache is located in the field next this parking lot on LaFranier Rd.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This cache should be an easy one for must people to find.  It is a large pill bottle with olive green tape on it. Inside you will find a logbook and a pen. So no need to bring a pen. (Well, on the other hand bring one just in case.) Sign and date the log. You may leave very small items if you like. But it will make it hard to get the logbook out of the bottle. That's it!!! Have fun and happy hunting.</groundspeak:long_description>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">We had searched this one in our early days of caching since it was really close to our cousins apartment. Unfortunately we were unsuccessful then, probably half because of our inexperience, and half because it was getting dark. Today we were determined to overcome, and we parked at the suggested building instead of bushwacking from the nearby apartments like last time. Our muggle cousin Donald found this after about 20 minutes of searching. We were about ready to give up, already having exhausted the hint and searched about everywhere conceivable. When I asked Don "Where the heck was it" he pointed to a spot out in the open on the ground. Sounds like our 'experience' was working against us on this one. We tried to replace it so the hint made sense, just a few feet from where we found it, but it is probably not where it should be. The log was wet and nearly full, but we found a spot to make our mark. TFTC</groundspeak:text>

I approached from the south and got within .15 of a mile and decided to buswhwack it to the cache.  After fighting off thick brush and some swampy terrain, I found the cache easily. Signed the log book, took nothing and left nothing.

It is a work in progress since I and others in the township voted to purchase the area for the new park. I also have volunteered my time and efforts with others to help with the work at the new park. After recently working on putting in some new trails I came across this cache area in which the large mature trees reminded me of giant elephants roaming around the forest :)  The large trunks look like an elephant's foot to me.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Please go to the related web page above and click on CRNA link for maps and more info on this new park.  Should any local cachers want to volunteer to help with the work at this new park contact me with this site and I will put you in contact with the right people. There is still a lot to do at the park and major work days were delayed by bad weather so any help would be appreciated. 

 Park off of M-37(Center road) at N44 47.179  W085 34.449. The cache is a small round lock n lock container with theme related camo and room for small trade items. The cache is in plain sight but not easy to see from the trail. Winter friendly into at least 6 feet of snow. The cache is just outside the entrance where the loop starts in the south wing very near the park boundary line but still within the park.  The south loop contains a delicate ecosystem, largely comprised of rare climax hemlock trees.  The trails in the south loop are designed to protect their sensitive root system, so stay on the trail when roaming with the elephants in that area.  No hunting allowed here so you can cache or hike without guns shots this fall and in the future. Please stay on the trails and respect the park boundaries and rules. And rule number one in work, play, or finding caches HAVE FUN!</groundspeak:long_description>

The Nature Education Reserve currently includes 435 acres with more
than 5 miles of developed trails located along the Boardman River,
The Grand Traverse Conservation District has just opened a
7,000-square-foot educational facility situated at the Sabin Pond
Trailhead. Located within the Reserve, the Keystone rapids are the
only rated stretch of rapids in the Lower Peninsula. 
&lt;p&gt;This cache is located in a small pine plantation along the
Oleson Bridge trail. The is a gift of the Oleson family who have
long been a major benefactor to the Traverse region. The river just
before it passes under the bridge is a favorite swimming hole and a
great place to take out after running the rapids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4" face="Times" color="red"&gt;It is not necessary to
jump through the sticker/pamphlet hoops to log this
cache.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got the idea for our Trekking Traverse Trails series from a
similar series in Florida. As a reward for the first 50 who wish
one and who complete the series, we have created a Path Tag on
which is the Traverse City logo. To acquire a tag, stop at the
Traverse City Visitors Center(
&lt;a href="http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=70e9c579-f72c-44c7-a0c3-b06d5830fd3b"&gt;
GC17HZ4&lt;/a&gt;), and pick up a free Trekking Traverse Trails
brochure.&lt;br /&gt;
In each cache container you will find a sticker for that cache.
Paste each of the ten stickers in the brochure, mail it in, and we
will sent you your tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This is an area in which i grew up, in fact i used to hike this area all the time, nelson road is a road that lots of people like to walk on, in fact i passed a few people today out hiding the cache. This cache is located just east of Buchans blueberry hill, my favorite place to come and pick your own blueberrys, when its blueberry season, i strongly reccommend you check this place out! The cache is an EXTREMELY well camoflauged micro, with only enough room for a very small log book, you must bring your own pen to sign! This cache is winter friendly, yet i expect it to be difficult to find at all times of the year! (which is why i have set the diffuculty level as such)

E-mail me if you would like additional hints :)

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">I found this spot is after looking for Whispering Pines #1 and I
thought it’d make a good virtual cache. This spot has a very nice
view of the river. I hope you enjoy the view, too.&lt;br /&gt;
I just hope you enjoy it too.&lt;br /&gt;
 Once you get down by the water, it looks like there might be a
good wading spot off to the right that’s shallow. Be careful if you
do. I didn't check it out to be sure. Watch out for poison ivy.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To log this cache take a nice picture looking out over the river at
this location. Having your GPS in the shot is no longer required.
(but not the leaning dead trees off to the right!).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 If you don't have a digital camera, e-mail me how many leafless
dead trees are over on the other side of the river when looking to
the right (They are leaning. Ignore the ones that are on the ground
or in the water). &lt;br /&gt;
In fall it will be a lot harder to answer this question.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Last month when I went caching in the rain, it was 72 degrees but the rain was heavier. Today at 38 degrees I was tempted to just hunker down by the fire and forgo my morning walk. However, Groundspeak showed a new winter friendly cache within 10 miles of the house. I resisted but that finally got me off my keister and into some rain gear. I pulled into the parking lot and saw I had the entire area to myself. That's one advantage to walking in the rain. A short stroll and a little searching yielded the well hidden cache and the coin prize for FTF. I did a solo dance, managing to avoid falling in the Boardman.Thanks for the coin, it's a beauty, and thanks for getting me out of the house. I was surprised to be first because of the tracks leading back toward the river from the main trail. Then I saw they lead to a place where you could keep your wig warm. What's up with that? As I returned to the parking lot, I was thinking that, back in the day when ABX was active, he and trashcan would probably have snagged this baby last night in the dark. Before his move, I think RGhiking would have been here at dawn.  I"m afraid that like us, the rest of the TC cachers have become a little more winter adverse and sedentary in the past few years. </groundspeak:text>

The coordinates are average of two readings, should get you close enough to the bench -- no need to climb the fence or go near the RR tracks. Take a load off!  Sit on the left end and look down to the cable clamp that ties the bench down. 

That's a magnetic nano, in case you've never seen one. It twists apart and there is a VERY tiny log in it. You will need your own pencil and a paperclip might be handy, too. If you have a spare pencil, maybe you could stick it in the ground near the cache.

If you look across the tracks, you'll see the building where I work. Enjoy your trip down the TART trail!</groundspeak:long_description>

border="0" /&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="green"&gt;This earthcache is located at
the canoe launch site on the Boardman River just before Beitner
Rapids.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="green"&gt;A watershed is a basin-like landform defined
by highpoints and ridgelines that descend into lower elevations and
stream valleys. A watershed carries water "shed" from the land
after rain falls and snow melts. Drop by drop, water is channeled
into soils, groundwaters, creeks, and streams, making its way to
larger rivers and eventually the sea. Water is a universal solvent,
affected by all that it comes in contact with: the land it
traverses, and the soils through which it travels. The important
thing about watersheds is: what we do on the land affects water
quality for all communities living downstream. In Grand Traverse
County, the largest watershed is the Boardman River Watershed,
which spans 295 square miles and drains approximately182,800 acres
of land through 130 miles of river and stream tributaries. Twelve
lakes ranging in size from a few acres to 60 acres drain into the
Boardman River.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="green"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="green"&gt;&lt;img src=
"http://img.geocaching.com/cache/71a33f33-c6b3-4a9e-885e-4f08205f060c.jpg"
border="0" /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="green"&gt;The Boardman River is considered one of
the top ten trout streams in Michigan and is one of the
particularly outstanding natural features of the Grand Traverse Bay
Region. The Boardman River Watershed is not problem free. A 1991
study entitled Boardman River Watershed Report identified over 600
eroded sites along the Boardman River and its tributaries; 85% of
these sites are the result of human activity. The sediment entering
the river from these sites has significantly degraded the
productivity of this state-designated "Blue Ribbon" trout stream
and has negatively impacted the recreational opportunities offered
by the river. In addition to correcting these problems, long term
protection of the area's soil and water resources as well as
improved riparian landowner and user group stewardship is
imperative.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="green"&gt;The topography of the Boardman River
Watershed is mostly flat, sandy plains broken locally by small
shallow depressions. Pothole bogs and swampy lands bordering stream
channels comprise a small portion of the total area. The glacial
moraine areas north and south of the river valley rise sharply to
defined highland ridges and broad plateaus. Glacial deposits are in
excess of 500 feet thick. The outer edge of the Port Huron Moraine
extends east-west across the southern third of the basin, while
part of the inner ridge of this moraine generally parallels the
area along the northern boundary of the basin. Between these two
prominent morainic ridges is a six- to 14-mile wide outwash plain
through which the Boardman River flows.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="green"&gt;The major soils in the valley areas of
the Rubicon-Grayling and Rubicon-Kalkaska types. These soil types
are, for the most part, dry sandy soils and acidic in nature, very
pervious and low in fertility. These dry, sandy, infertile soils
are what make the Boardman River streambanks so fragile and
susceptible to erosion. Soils in the river bottom upstream of
Kalkaska are mainly peat and muck.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

there is a three-sided sign that has information about the Boardman
River and its watershed. In order to get credit for this cache,
post a picture with you and your GPS in it with the river in the
background when you log this cache and answer the following
questions:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="green"&gt;&lt;font color="blue"&gt;&lt;font color=
"purple"&gt;1) What large lake does the Boardman watershed ultimately
drain into?&lt;br /&gt;
2) This area has several trail systems. How many are listed on the
sign?&lt;br /&gt;
3) Take a look at the bottom of the river. Is the bottom sandy from
erosion or mostly gravel as a result of nearby stream bank erosion
containment efforts?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This cache site was close to our campsite at Holiday Park and had to find an Earthcache in Michigan.   My son loved the location and wanted to go canoeing... which I thought was a great idea... except we did not have a canoe!    Well, maybe next time!     He was very intrigued with how the stream passed under the road and had to go look... good thing Mom was not with us.... two heart attacks in the family would have been a bad thing.  We survived and will post our pics when we get a chance to take them off my phone.  TFTC!

Draw a quick Picture of you or your team in our log Book then randomly select a Fun Fact Question Block , write down your answer and sign and date. There is a fun toy for the first finder. If you enter from Center ...check out one of the most beautiful views on the Peninsula. 
But be prepared it's gonna be a bumpy ride and you may only be able to access it from Center road during the winter months, may want to park at a more open space then walk to the location.  When you're done, check out 2 nearby Antique Shops (one is open every day)or toast your find at any of the nearby wineries!!!  CHEERS</groundspeak:long_description>

I had headed out past garfield with my pickup truck and picked up a load of wood that we could use for firewood. I quickly headed home as there were already many people waiting for me to return with this load of wood for our fire. I was headed out center road when the tailgate to my truck broke and fell open scattering the wood all over center road. WHOOPS! guess its time for me to buy a new truck. Anyway i quickly picked up as many of the pieces of wood as i could, however some of them were never found!</groundspeak:long_description>

Psyched for the wi-fi because without it I wouldn't have been able to get the cache info saved on my iPhone for offline use - no 3G here. We took the dogs for a two hour walk including the art walk where we left the trail and quickly spotted tge cache from about 60'. Insides are a little wet; cache could use some TLC. Left a bug; please let me take it out of the cache it's in before you log it ;) otherwise you'll be grabbing it from Long Island. Very excited to hit a cache. It's been a while. TNLBSL.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">A violent storm in November 1886 resulted in the loss of thirty ships and the lives of thirty-seven sailors.  One victim of the storm was the Schooner Marinette.  She, and the Schooner Menekaunee, had been loaded with lumber and were being towed by the Steamer Manistique, bound for Chicago.  The Manistique and her tow sought shelter from the fury of the hurricane winds in the lee of the Manitou Islands.  At 2:20 AM on November 18, the tow broke up and the Marinette, with its crew of eight were left to their fate.  She struck the beach, south of the present day Watervale resort at 10:30 PM.  All but one of the crew (including Mary, the cook, and her thirteen year old daughter, Minnie) perished.  C. W. Annis was the only survivor.  He crawled to a nearby farmhouse.  It was a sad end to his first trip before the mast.

Today, the wooden skeleton of the Marinette still rests in the shifting sands south of Watervale Inn and Resort.  In 2002, it was clearly visible all summer.  It reappeared in the shifting sands in June of 2004 when I recorded the following coordinates (N 44 32.613, W 086 13.577).  We visited the site on May 21, 2005 – the wreck was not visible.  Who knows when we will see it again?

Even without sighting the wreck of the Marinette, this is a beautiful stretch of beach for a hike.  Park at the end of Watervale Road (N 44 33.274 W 086 13.291) and cross the dunes to the water’s edge. (Recently, a number of no-trespassing signs have sprung up -- I believe they apply to the Watervale Beach proper and not necessarily the Lake Michigan Shoreline which is part of the Grand Traverse Nature Conservancy.)  Walk South about 0.75 miles to the coordinates listed and look for a small cache hidden under pieces of wood and bark.  Another option is to take the 3.8 mile long Old Baldy Trail which starts near the Watervale Inn and climbs to the top of the bluff.  The trail then takes you down to the water’s edge south of the site – you can look for the cache on hike North. 

Update August 26, 2005:  For a more detailed account of the wreck and some great photos, check out www.snavemij.com/watervale/marinette/</groundspeak:long_description>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">After seeing luvtufsh's pictures, we decided to revisit the site.  We originally found the cache in 2005.  The wreck was visible at that time, but not to the extent that it is now.  We went again with another caching team a couple of years ago, but the remains were not visible then.  As we were walking to the site today, we met some other people who had been out looking at the wreck.  They said it had been visible most of this summer.  We also enjoyed the information on the web page in the cache description.  Very interesting.  Here are a few more pictures of the wreck as it was this afternoon.

I took My Nephew Kyle and his girl friend Stephanie and her sister Stacy and their friends Rich and Sara. They have never been geocaching before and they loved looking for the cache. Rich found it and He took a green poker chip. 
We took several pics of the Marinette as about 25-30 Ft were visible on shore. I will post pics later

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">Here is a truly unique Virtual for you to experience.  It is an illusion dependant on an individuals perception.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Things are not always as they seem.  Here in The Mystery Spot perception becomes distorted.  Some speculate it’s because of a magnetic anomaly caused by the crash of a giant meteor that is alleged to have created the hill.  The locals claim it the site of UFO sightings &amp; alien abductions.  Still...others say it is the doorway to another dimension.  You be the judge…..

To experience this Virtual:

Go the above coordinates.  Vehicle must be facing South. When safe &amp; clear, stop vehicle on road.  When stopped at coordinates you should find a yellow sign along side and at the right of your vehicle. (Apparently the yellow sign had been taken for analysis by our alien visitors. However, I have reports from the field that the yellow sign has mysteriously reappeared!) Make sure there is no other car behind you. Look forward, place your vehicle in neutral and release brake.

To claim this you must have visited after this became posted as a Virtual and email me the answers to the following:

1 – How many eggs in a dozen?
2 – How many telephone poles in the immediate area?
3 – What did you experience?
4 - *BONUS QUESTION* - If you weren't here...where would you be?

DISCLAIMER: I can't promise that you'll "get" the illusion...or that you won't be abducted by space aliens (or maybe some illegal aliens)...but it worked for me. 
By the way....I am now Geocaching on the planet Zoana....

Enjoy!

As with "TART Nano 1", the only challenge to this one is being DISCREET when you retrieve and sign the log. The coordinates are average of three readings, should get you close enough -- no need to climb the fence or go near the RR tracks. Read about the planet Uranus, then look on the back of the sign's green post. 

That's a magnetic nano, in case you've never seen one. It twists apart and there is a VERY tiny log in it. You will need your own pencil and a paperclip might be handy, too. If you have a spare pencil, maybe you could stick it in the ground near the cache. And if you haven't yet visited "TART Nano 1 Take a Load Off", go west about half a mile.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;It has long been a mystery just what caused Yermamma been
Maudlin, leader of the Al Quacka Sleeper Cell, to assume her
radical ways. Now from an undisclosed location she has granted an
interview to disclose details.... It turns out that in her youth
she was befriended by King Kong. In fact, they were constant
companions up until that climactic day on top of the Empire State
Building. Afterwards as Kong lay dying, Yermamma promised that she
would exact revenge - thus was born the Al Quacka Sleeper Cell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This geocache is located near the site of the interview but don't
expect to discover Yermamma there. She is doubtless off on another
Al Quacka mission.&lt;/p&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">We took some extra time to get out and enjoy nature on this slightly overcast, but otherwise wonderful black Friday. We had come along with (sympathetic muggle) cousin Don and from 300ft away he said "it is probably there" pointing to the probable spot. I related this to my better half, and mistakenly included the word "Dear" which we laughed at being confused for its homonym. We had been worried about interrupting someones hunt, and realized that we didn't have any blaze orange, so this was going to be a business only cache. We quickly made the find, right where cousin Don the sympathetic muggle said it would be, made note of the full log book. Thankfully the last little bit of the back cover was just enough to put our name on. We made our way back out of the preserve without incident commenting on the terrain as unsuited for hunting. Relating this to Grandpa (a lifelong resident and dedicated hunter) over dinner he says that a fella' he knows has done well for himself hunting this preserve, so our summation that it was all swamp and therefore not good hunting was far from true.

Thanks for the fun and introducing us to another neat spot near our grandparents place.</groundspeak:text>

It involves a short walk in a quiet wooded area where much game, including deer, can be seen.  Be sure to enjoy the view of Pyatt Lake even though people from this area may call it a "Puddle!"

Parking for the cache is at the entrance to the Nature Preserve off of Pyatt Lake Road.

This is a regular cache although the container is of medium size. It is so happy as it is filled with lots of "smiley" items, and if possible please exchange with like treasures!

All fourth grade students in Michigan study Michigan History as part of their Social Studies curriculum and learning about latitude &amp; longitude is part of the course. Geocaching is a great way to help students relate to these concepts!

Each year, after studying about lat/long, the 4th graders will have fun with geocaching and then will be responsible for maintaining their caches for others to enjoy! They will also enjoy reading the log to see who has visited the cache.</groundspeak:long_description>

The cache is an ammo box with several trade items, kid friendly! Make sure you stop and take a look at the boardwalk and the overlook platform that looks out over Pyatt lake. This is one of my favorite thinking areas. Hope you enjoy this place as much as i do. By the way, if you head out here are dusk or after dark, there is a family of owls that makes its home, in the woods around the cache site. This area is mostly dense confierious forest, so gps signal is usually weak, look for clearings in the trees to aquire better signal!

My name is Bear and I am a Reading Education Assistance Dog (R.E.A.D.).  I work at PCL listening to kids read books.  This cache is  my special box, so trade items should only be related to reading or writing (pencils, journals, small books, etc).

The coordinates posted will guide you to an additional (written) clue that you will need to solve to find the final cache.

The George and Ada Reffitt Nature Reserve is owned and managed by
the Grand Traverse Regional Land Conservancy which owns and
maintains nature preserves within Antrim, Benzie, Grand Traverse,
Kalkaska, and Manistee counties. The Reffitt property consists of
83 acres with a 1.7 mile loop trail and boardwalk.

jump through the sticker/pamphlet hoops to log this
cache.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got the idea for our Trekking Traverse Trails series from a
similar series in Florida. As a reward for the first 50 who wish
one and who complete the series, we have created a Path Tag on
which is the Traverse City logo. To acquire a tag, stop at the
Traverse City Visitors Center(
&lt;a href="http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=70e9c579-f72c-44c7-a0c3-b06d5830fd3b"&gt;
GC17HZ4&lt;/a&gt;), and pick up a free Trekking Traverse Trails
brochure.&lt;br /&gt;
In each cache container you will find a sticker for that cache.
Paste each of the ten stickers in the brochure, mail it in, and we
will sent you your tag.&lt;/p&gt;

Each year, after studying about lat/long, the 4th graders will have fun with geocaching and then will be responsible for maintaining their caches for others to enjoy!  They will also enjoy reading the log to see who has visited the cache.</groundspeak:long_description>

Thompsonville is a small village in Benzie Co. Michigan along the Betsie River.

Sumner S. Thompson, an astute businessman from Massachusetts, was operating his lumber company just south of the present village.  In 1889 he gave a deed to the Frankfort and South Eastern Railroad for a 100 foot right of way across lands where the railroad might be located.  Later that year Thompson died in Frankfort at the age 66 and on June 23rd of the following year, Thompson’s heirs platted the town of Thompsonville.  The Beecher side of the village was platted on June 30, 1890 by the heirs of Henry Ward Beecher, the writer, abolitionist, and brother of Harriet Beecher Stowe, the writer of Uncle Tom’s Cabin.  

The advent of the railroads coming to Thompsonville was a reason for the success of the area.  In 1889 the Toledo and Ann Arbor and North Michigan Railroad was completed from Toledo, Ohio to the town of Copemish, three miles south of Thompsonville.  In the same year the Frankfort and Southeastern Railroad was completed from Copemish to Frankfort going through Thompsonville.  Also the Chicago and Western Michigan Railroad was completed through Thompsonville.  By 1892 railroads consolidated and after another railroad’s bankruptcy in 1893, the Ann Arbor Railroad came into being.  Around 1910, the Ann Arbor Railroad operated the “Ping Pong” passenger train from Thompsonville to Frankfort running every two hours during the summer months bringing passengers from Chicago to Thompsonville on the Pere Marquette Railroad where the passengers changing to the Ping Pong for the final leg of  the journey to Frankfort.  During the winter months, the Ping Pong made the trip once a day.
 
 In 1895 Thompsonville got its own electric power company.  By the turn of the century, the population of Thompsonville grew to around 1500, with two hotels, one having a Chinese laundry.  Social activities abound with an Opera House where traveling show companies staged performances.  There were churches, schools, stores and several saloons.  One of the saloons had a cigar factory on its second floor.  From the book, Shared Moments, A Journey Through Time,  “Before the railroads, Thompsonville was a small town…There were five saloons in a town that had a population of about 500 people… Five saloons and I think two grocery stores.  You need more whiskey than you did groceries, you know.”
Several successful businesses were established in Thompsonville, the Piqua Handle Company was started in 1910, making bowls, containers and handles for various useful items.  Another company, the Thompsonville Cooperage Company made many items even the tent poles for World War I pup tents.  Another company, the Oval Wood Dish factory, made dishes similar to the paper products we use today.  This company continued to operated until 1927 when timber supplies dwindled.  With the decline of the quality lumber in the area, Thompsonville became a less important commercial town.  By the 1950s the railroads stopped running and by the 1970s the population was around 200 people.  

Today Thompsonville is the home of Crystal Mountain, a skiing and outdoor sports resort featuring condos and lovely homes.  In this complex is the Michigan Art Legacy Park comprising of over a mile and half of hiking trails featuring more than forty works of art in a woodland setting.  The Betsie River is enjoyed by fishermen and canoeists for scenic outdoors activities.  Thompsonville is one of the trailheads for the Betsie Valley Trailway, a 26 mile trail system along the Betsie River built on the former Ann Arbor Railroad tracks.

With such an interesting history, Thompsonville is a wonderful place to visit, to explore and to find caches.  Please rehide carefully and place some bark and twigs to conceal the hiding place.</groundspeak:long_description>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">We had solved this a long long time ago. Now that we had a little bit of time on a wonderful sunny (at times) day we made sure we cleaned up this solved but unsought puzzle. After being on the right trail, but not knowing it, we got on the wrong trail, then noticed the no tresspassing signs, so a simple return to the right trail wasn't going to happen. We took the long walk around and around before getting back on track. The other logs said the coords were off a bit, and knowing my penchant for mistakes (especially numerically) we were a bit worried, eventhough she had solved this, I had entered it into the GPSr, plenty of room for error there. After a 10 minute search turned up  nothing we were really worried. Then sticking to the hint we found it about 40ft southwest of our solution (hopefully the correct one!) Thankfully this Whitard puzzle is now off the list! This gave us a pleasant feeling that we had plans to duplicate later when we went after "Class of '43" AGAIN! An awesome place for a cache, there should be more here... Well there are still several unsolved Whitard puzzles... So maybe there are, and we just don't know it! TFTC</groundspeak:text>

Base maps showed us South of the railroad, so I'm not sure what was going on with coordinates, but given all the recent "coordinates were off" logs, I suggest someone visit this and see if it needs updating/correcting.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The Traverse Area Recreaction and Transportation trails are a wonderful resource in beautiful Traverse City. All they lack are a few geocaches. So ... this is number 3. 

As with "TART Nano 1" and "TART Nano 2", the only challenge to this one is being DISCREET when you retrieve and sign the log. The coordinates are average of three readings, should get you close enough -- no need to climb the fence or go near the RR tracks. See the sign? It's right down in the grass attached to the metal signpost.

That's a magnetic nano, in case you've never seen one. It twists apart and there is a VERY tiny log in it. You will need your own pencil and a paperclip might be handy, too. If you have a spare pencil, maybe you could stick it in the ground near the cache. And if you haven't yet visited "TART Nano 1 Take a Load Off" or 'TART Nano 2 Seventh Rock", go west on the trail.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True"> The cache is in an ammo box.  It contains several CDs, and various other potpourri picked up from other Traverse City caches.  The terrains rates a 2.5 due to the potentially swampy and muddy trail to get to the cache, plus cache locations many pointy branches. Please wear your camp clothes!   Parking for the Reffitt Trail can be at the T.A.R.T. Trail parking area on Parsons Rd. by 3 mile Rd., or at TBA Tech Center.   The cache is 20 to 30 feet off of the trail.  Please be careful of the many dead branches protecting the treasure!
&lt;P&gt;
For a really great day, bike in using the T.A.R.T. trail, and hide your bike just inside of the Reffitt  Trail (no bikes allowed on trail).  The cache is approximately half a mile back using either entrance, depending on which way you go!  The spoiler will give it away, so please try your best first!

has returned to Traverse City after being gone for three years and
four months. Fudgie has decided to stay here and open a fudge shop.
Every morning Fudgie arrives and makes huge amounts of fudge. He
ships most of his fudge right out to friends he met traveling in
California. Unfortunately, his fudge is in such demand (especially
the cherry fudge), that you probably won't find any left. Fudgie
still hopes you will visit his shop where he has many gift items to
offer you. He says he would also love to swap stories with any
travelers passing by.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

It is best to park in the north parking lot off of 3 Mile Road. To avoid heavy school traffic, it is best to avoid the start and end of the school day.

Then I found a creek to find a way across it also.  Finally made it to the GZ and did not take long to come up with the container.  Everything was in good shape.  Picked up the TB so it would not have to be there all winter.  Found the trail to take out but still got to the creek and had to find a way across it also, no bridge.  Think this should be done without snow on the ground.

We brought cousin Don (a sympathetic muggle) along for this long soggy walk. He was quite a trooper, following our waterproof hiking boot footsteps with soggy sock drenching sneaker footsteps of his own. We were glad to do this one with the temps right around 40 degrees, and couldn't imagine doing this during the heart of mosquito season! After retrieving, signing the log and replacing the container, we had a choice to make. "Back the way we came, or continue on the path." Since we typically enjoy seeing new sights, we decided to tread new ground and found our way back to the car easily. TFTC</groundspeak:text>

&lt;p&gt;This is a vastly under-utilized micro-park. If you want a piece
of the Bay to yourself, bring a picnic, you will be alone. It is
dedicated to the memory of Genevieve Steiger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Born in Ohio, she grew up there and in the Fife Lake area. She
began her working career as a teacher in a one-room school near
Summit City.&lt;br&gt;
 After fifteen years of living, working and starting her family in
the Detroit area, Gen returned to Traverse City in 1937. A single
mom with four kids to raise ranging from teens to an infant, she
began as a bookkeeper at the Cigar Box Factory. Over time she
changed businesses and became a manager and eventually the owner of
the Credit Bureau of Traverse City. She also became the first
female licensed to sell real estate in the area.&lt;br&gt;
 Always a supporter of the public schools, among other positions,
she served as the President of the PTA. She was also an early
active booster of Northwestern Michigan College, serving as
President of the Wigwam Club and on the library planning committee.
She was a member, officer and leader in the Business and
Professional Women, Zonta, Red Cross, Michigan Heart Association,
Community Council and the Associated Credit Bureaus of Michigan. In
1962 she was selected as Traverse City's Person of the Year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- End NMG Code --&gt; This cache was the idea of my wife who
grew up in Traverse City. She was one of the first classes to go
through East Junior High. While out hiking she often mentioned how
this little nature walk that would make a great area for a cache.
The nature walk very nice with a elevated boardwalk through a cedar
swamp. I am not sure if Teachers still used to use this area for
science classes, but it deffinatly made an impression on my wife
years ago. The cache is ~4' off the ground so it should be pretty
winter friendly (unless it get frozen in place). As always have fun
in nature! *Please use stealth when hunting for and logging the
cache, it can be a muggle rich enviroment!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

TRAILS&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The 10.5 mile long TART (Traverse Area Recreational Trail) is a
paved urban transportation corridor with an eastern end point at
M-72 (Bates Road) in Acme Township and a western end point at the
M-22/M-72 intersection in Traverse City. 
&lt;p&gt;The eastern trail section from M-72 to Lautner Road is 2 miles,
then the trail leapfrogs to Bunker Hill Road and continues for 8.4
miles into Traverse City. At its western end point the TART trail
connects to the Leelanau Trail, which runs north to Suttons
Bay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TART Trail's route gives users views of both West and East
Grand Traverse Bays, through Traverse City neighborhoods and the
Mitchell Creek watershed. Locals and visitors alike are found
enjoying the TART, including families, bicyclists, dog walkers,
parents pushing strollers and in-line skaters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4" face="Times" color="red"&gt;It is not necessary to
jump through the sticker/pamphlet hoops to log this
cache.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got the idea for our Trekking Traverse Trails series from a
similar series in Florida. As a reward for the first 50 who wish
one and who complete the series, we have created a Path Tag on
which is the Traverse City logo. To acquire a tag, stop at the
Traverse City Visitors Center(
&lt;a href="http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=70e9c579-f72c-44c7-a0c3-b06d5830fd3b"&gt;
GC17HZ4&lt;/a&gt;), and pick up a free Trekking Traverse Trails
brochure.&lt;br /&gt;
In each cache container you will find a sticker for that cache.
Paste each of the ten stickers in the brochure, mail it in, and we
will sent you your tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This multi-cache will take you past the resting place of the pioneers of Northport and Leelanau Township. We wanted to create this a few months ago, but were recently inspired by the movie THE BUCKET LIST. 

Take a rambling journey from stage to stage and ponder your remaining time, then record your “things to do before you kick the bucket” on the “markers” provided in the final stage of the cache.

Visit the Northport library for more details on the pioneers and their contributions in “A History of Leelanau Township”, written and collected by local historians and compiled in 1988.

The above coordinates will bring you to the resting place of the man who platted and named Northport. From here you will need to find the following information to get the coordinates to stage 2.

Stage 2: N45.08.abc    W085.37.def

a = Joseph was born Jan. 2__

b = Ursala died Feb. __1

c = Ursala died in 1__77

d = Ursala lived 74 yrs. 8 mo __1 days

e = Joseph died in 188__ plus 1

f = Joseph was born in 17__6

Stage 3: N45.08.abc   W085.37.def

a = Woolsey G.A.R. post __99

b = Jacob donated it in 19__2

c = presented to Woolsey post in 1__01,  minus 4

d = Woolsey G.A.R. post  __99

e = presented to cemetery __932

f = Woolsey G.A.R. post __99, plus 3

Stage 4: John is here R.I.P.
From this resting place you will need to take ab paces due N and then cd paces WNW to locate the final stage.

His final year a9b4

His first year cd46

Now sign the log and use the pencil to write your “to do“ list on the “markers” provided.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="blue"&gt;Got Benchmark? This whereigo cache covers
eight benchmarks, including an existing cache inside a benchmark
and a real physical cache (final location) over an area covering
approximately six vertical miles on US 31. All of the benchmarks
are of the "park-n-grab" variety and are generally 100 feet or less
from US 31. The final, however, is not and is a quart sized plastic
jar wrapped in cammo tape that is located in a nature preserve
along the route of this wherigo cache.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="black"&gt;&lt;font color="black"&gt;Note: You must
complete the wherigo tasks in sequential order (first task is at
the listed coordinates) to complete the cartridge and find the
final physical cache.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;font color="black"&gt;&lt;font color="black"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="blue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="brown"&gt;
In surveying, benchmark is a survey marker with a precisely known
vertical elevation. The term benchmark originates from the chiseled
horizontal marks that surveyors made in stone structures, into
which an angle-iron could be placed to form a "bench" for a
leveling rod, thus ensuring that a leveling rod could be accurately
repositioned in the same place in future. These marks were usually
indicated with a chiseled arrow below the horizontal line. More
enduring benchmarks may be chiseled into a wall (the usual type in
the UK) or marked by a small brass or aluminum, steel pin, or bolt
attached to a stable foundation, such as a concrete post, bridge
abutment, building, or a purpose-made concrete block. These markers
are then used as starting points for subsequent surveys to
establish the elevation of nearby points. The height of a benchmark
is calculated relative to the heights of nearby benchmarks in a
network extending from a fundamental benchmark, a point with a
precisely known relationship to the level datum of the area,
typically mean sea level.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="blue"&gt;&lt;font color="brown"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="red"&gt;The
most famous benchmark of all is the Four Corners Benchmark, the
only location in the U.S. where the boundaries of four states
(Utah, Colorado, Arizona and New Mexico) meet. A picture of that is
below:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

To find this cache the proper way and to truly experience the hunt

both of which you can get from

Great job; no surprise, really - We've never been disappointed by a RatherGoHiking/Waypoint Kid hide of any kind. This was a lot of fun, and we really hope the WhereIGo concept catches on. There is only ONE in the metro Detroit area! This was a great way to spend a last morning in the north woods before heading back downstate to 'civilization'. Good job!

The purpose of the tour was to complete the Lower Peninsula of Michigan as well as find Geocache 612 (Michigan's 2nd oldest active cache). We signed the log NWCT to save time and space on the log.

We added Goldfinch and fins&amp;feathers to the tour.  This cartridge worked without any flaws and found all the locations easily.  The only issue that we came across was the bicyclist that hit the railroad tracks at 23 mph and flipped over his handlebars when he answered the phone call from his ex-wife.  Once we helped him we headed out and completed the Wherigo.  TFTCSL</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">At the end of the 19th century, some dairy farmers observed that the south end of "Ol' Bossy" is wider than the front. They reasoned that a pie shaped stall would be more efficient. Thus the Round Barn was born. In grand Traverse County, we have two of these historic structures. This multi cache will take you past both of them and then on into the state forest for the cache. 
The coordinates will take you to the most photographed of the two, find the street address for this farm, add the first three digits to each the coordinates; 44 35.610N and 085 35.107W. This will take you to the other barn. (It's just 'round the corner) Subtract the street address for this farm from the coordinates; 44 37.758N 085 36.009 to go to the cache in the state forest. (It's just 'round the corner and down the road.)
The cache is an ammo can in a traditional spot. There is a seasonal road near by. The cache is winter friendly but may require skis or snowshoes in snow conditions.
Original contents of the cache were:

We made our way to the forest, but we picked the wrong seasonal road and walked nearly a mile through the woods to find it.  Great adventure! Would have been much easier if we would have picked the right road.  TFTC! </groundspeak:text>

After finding stage 2 I looked at the old GPS and saw a yet another seasonal road that was just round the corner.  DO NOT ATTEMPT with out 4 wheel drive this time of year!  Good thing I did...  A little interesting as I do not think anybody has been down that section in quite a while.  After a little searching found the cache in great condition.  Dry and still has a few goodies in it.  Took a baseball and left a few bracelets and launched my new Dads b-day coin.  Thanks for the fun day and history behind these barns. </groundspeak:text>

Our guess must have been real close because it put us in front of the other barn. Then there is always the awful feeling that you did the math wrong when you are way out in the wilderness looking for the final stage. Then you find it and pat yourself on the back for being so durn smart. TFTC. Eeebow &amp; Mrs. Will work for cache.</groundspeak:text>

We then read prior log entry and were able to find it right away.  The logbook was previously wet and is now frozen into a solid chunk.  We had to sign the outer edges of log with a sharpie.

The cache is on the newest public land on Old Mission peninsula - at the site of the future Peter Dougherty Museum.  The land was recently purchased, and the house will be restored and will house the Old Mission Historical Society's museum.  It's not open yet, but hopefully will be in a few years.

Peter Dougherty was a missionary who came to this area in 1839.  He founded the mission that gives Old Mission its name.  The house was built about that time, and is the oldest house on the peninsula, and one of the oldest houses in northern michigan.  You can find more information about the house and its history at http://www.omphistoricalsociety.org/

•	Trees planted between crop fields and creeks can remove many pollutants before they reach the stream.
•	A large tree can remove more than 400 litres of water from the ground and discharge it into the air in a day.
•	One large tree in a single day can produce the amount of oxygen required by 4 people.
•	Trees can shade your home and cool it by up to 10 degrees Celsius in the summer.
•	Coffee, rubber, lumber, herbal medicines and soaps all come from trees.
•	Paper comes from trees as well. Each Canadian uses about 1,300 kg of paper products and 2 m2 of lumber a year.  This is the equivalent to a 30 m tall tree that is 45 cm in diameter.
•	Sugar Maple trees are 'tapped' to siphon off sap in the spring to make maple syrup. It takes over 175 litres of Sugar Maple sap to make 4 litres of maple syrup.
•	Trees are the longest living and largest organisms on earth.
•	The oldest known living inhabitant on earth is a Bristlecone Pine named "Methuselah" in California.  This tree is over 4,760 years old.
•	The tallest living tree is a Redwood in the United States that stands over 111 m tall.
•	The slowest growing tree known is a White Cedar. It grows on a cliff in the Great Lake area of Canada. Although it is 155 years old, it is only 10 cm tall.
•	Arbor Day began over 125 years ago to plant trees on Nebraska's treeless prairie.  Today people everywhere plant trees on Arbor Day.</groundspeak:long_description>

After teaming up with the Dynamic Dino Duo for an authentic fifties lunch at Don's Drive in, we set out to seek the seven caches which have appeared since our last outing. This was the first of the day. We found fairly quickly although our choice of a trail required a bit of a bushwack. Took nothing, left our card and a pack of glitter tubes. I do have an issue with the terrain rating. The owner may want to reevaluate the difficulty. There are folks out there who enjoy our activity despite having limited mobility. As indicated in the rating system one the cache listing form, a one rating indicates that the cache is accessible even if they use a walker or a wheel chair. These caches do not fit that category.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The cache is located near the Old Mission Inn which was built in 1869 by George and Betsy Hedden, it was known as Hedden Hall. It also served as the Old Mission Post Office till 1889. 
In 1902 it became The Porter House when it was bought by Alfred and Ella Porter. They ran the Old Mission Telephone Company there from 1906 to 1926.They also ran a stage coach service that picked up guests from the steamships that docked in the bay. In 1932 two famous guests who signed the inn's register were Babe Ruth and Joe Louis. The cost of their stay including dinner and breakfast was $2.00. 
In 1945 the Inn was bought by the Nevingers and it became known as the Old Mission Inn. The Nevingers were the first to install plumbing and electricity in the inn. Prior to that the guests used two outhouses and chamber pots at night. 
In 1998 the Inn was purchased by Bruce and Angie Jensen who have been restoring it to its former glory.They run the Inn as a Bed and Breakfast and have a wonderful collection of period antiques which include a 1880's Post Office, 1901 Stage coach,1906 telephone switchboard, 1870's flag and a 70 foot "Hall of History".

the United States, &lt;font color="red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;who died from eating
cherries.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;I have lived in the Traverse City area for nearly five years
now and there is something I have to get off my chest. There is
another side to cherries.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;img src=

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;b&gt;General Zachary Taylor on his Deathbed July 9,
1850&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Zachary Taylor, "Old Rough and Ready", hero of the
Mexican-American War, was no match for the cherries he ate on a
swelteringly hot July 4th 1850 as he attended a ceremony to
dedicate the new Washington Monument. He quickly became ill and
within five days he was dead having succumbed to &lt;i&gt;cholera
morbus.&lt;/i&gt; Had this unfortunate event not occurred, our history
could have been different, the road to eventual Southern Seccession
have taken a different path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finders of this cache are asked to put their comments about this
tragic event and cherries in general in their logs. The cache is
small and should be easily found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is high time "the other side of cherries" was brought to
light. &lt;b&gt;After all, if cherries are really that great, why did
George Washington cut down that tree?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="blue"&gt;In surveying, benchmark is a survey
      marker with a precisely known vertical elevation. The term
      benchmark originates from the chiseled horizontal marks that
      surveyors made in stone structures, into which an angle-iron
      could be placed to form a "bench" for a leveling rod, thus
      ensuring that a leveling rod could be accurately repositioned
      in the same place in future. These marks were usually
      indicated with a chiseled arrow below the horizontal line.
      More enduring benchmarks may be chiseled into a wall (the
      usual type in the UK) or marked by a small brass or aluminum,
      steel pin, or bolt attached to a stable foundation, such as a
      concrete post, bridge abutment, building, or a purpose-made
      concrete block. These markers are then used as starting
      points for subsequent surveys to establish the elevation of
      nearby points.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="blue"&gt;The height of a benchmark is calculated
relative to the heights of nearby benchmarks in a network extending
from a fundamental benchmark, a point with a precisely known
relationship to the level datum of the area, typically mean sea
level.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

"She was once very beautiful and lived far in the north were the sun didn't visit. Being very curious, she wanted to see the sun, and asked the Goddess Athena for permission to visit the south. Athena refused to allow her to visit. Medusa got angry and dared to say that Athena hadn't given her permission because she was jealous of her beauty. That was it! Athena was angered and punished her by turning her hair into snakes and cursing her by making her so ugly that who ever looks at her eyes would turn into stone."

This must be a very colorful place in October with all of the hardwoods here, but today,almost all of the colors are on the ground leaving open views to the houses high up on the ridge.  We arrived at the site and began our search about 40-50' S of where the well hidden container was eventually found in a likely spot at 1:50.  TN L-Sig Card.

There was no indication in the cache description of where to park, or the location of the trailhead. We had moved the car and parked on the road near Sitting Pretty (wish we'd known this spot before climbing the ski hill!!!) Walking to The Medusa from there, it is a nasty hike up and down some steep hills with a lot of leaves on the ground, making it very slippery. We found the cache, signed the log, and headed over to Shadow of the Great White Ghost. It would be EXTREMELY helpful to including parking coordinates and trailhead location those of us who are not from the immediate area. Thanks for the hide.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Welcome to our cache! Can you guess why it's called Sitting Pretty? Have a rest and check out the view. 

Here's a little information about Mt. Holiday Ski and Recreation Area, Michigan's only non-profit ski hill:
This history of Mt. Holiday began in 1949 with a simple idea executed by the East Bay Businessmen's Association: to bring skiing to Traverse City's east side as a way to break up the long winters when many businesses shut down. The Michigan Department of Natural Resources gave the group permission to clear a run on what was Fife Lake State Forest land and Holiday Hills Ski Area was born. Later, land would be traded with the state to acquire the property comprising the ski area. 

During the 1950s, volunteers began construction on the main lodge, which was built with lumber salvaged from the Coast Guard station barracks. The hill grew as well - the original single tow rope was expanded to include another tow rope and two T-bars. 

The 1950s saw other expansion as well; in 1957 Ray Sutton and Dr. James Hall, Jr. traded land with the state to acquire more acreage. That summer, Hall's son Tom carved out additional ski runs on the hill with the assistance of local jail inmates. 

In 1985, Warren and Sue Brosch bought and ran the ski area. Over the 14 years they operated Mt. Holiday the Brosch Family added two chairlifts, a half-pipe for snowboarders (a first for Michigan and perhaps the Midwest), and a new ski patrol building. Sadly, Warren died in 1999 after a tragic accident at the ski area he loved. Because of their dedication to the ski hill, the Brosch Family is fondly remembered by many generations of skiers. 

Two years after Warren's death, the facility was closed with an uncertain future. As perspective buyers waited in the wings, a band of local concerned citizens rallied to the cause, raising $1.2 million in capital to acquire the property and begin restoration of the Mt. Holiday area. 

Today, the not-for-profit organization is focused on providing affordable winter and summer recreational opportunities for the youth - in particular the underprivileged. To that end, two skiership funds have been established to allow every child a chance to learn to ski or snowboard regardless of ability to pay. These scholarships - the Tom Hall Memorial Skiership and Warren Brosch Memorial Skiership - offer lift tickets, rentals, and lessons to any child who qualifies. 

Every donor can be proud of what has been done with his or her gift: the future development rights of Mt. Holiday's 46 bay-view acres have been deeded away, ensuring that this area will never be developed. And for that, the children of this region are grateful.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">After a two track tour, take a hike down a fairly steep slope to a
serene spot.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">When we saw that Tree Planter has placed a cache in Hoosier Valley
I "knew" just about where it would be. Oops! I was wrong. The Tree
Planter caches that we have come to know and love, take you on a
hike through the woods to a spot near or by water. We anticipate
hearing a stream as we approach the cache. &lt;br&gt;
 This cache is placed in the area I expected the TP cache to be.
First, navigate your way through a maze of trails and two tracks,
then hike less than .2 miles down a slope through a stand of
towering hemlocks to find the cache where a small tributary joins
Jaxon Creek on it's way to the Boardman River. The tree cover here
is heavy and I had a hard time getting a solid set of coordinates.
The cache is in the center of one of the pictures I have uploaded. 
&lt;p&gt;In the 1880's, most of the land in close proximity to the
Boardman was lumbered off by the Hannah and Lay Company. What was
left behind was a barren tract of white pine stumps with an
occasional stands of hardwoods. The owners sent a representative to
Jay County Indiana to sell the land for farming. About thirty
families took up the offer of cheap land. They gathered up their
possessions and loaded what they could into covered wagons and
herded their live stock north.&lt;br&gt;
These hardy (fool hardy?) folks from the Hoosier state gave their
name to the valley that ran seven miles from the settlement at
Mayfield to the one that used to exist at Beitner. They settled on
farms that ranged in size from quarter (80 acres) to half (160
acres) sections of land.&lt;br&gt;
In the beginnng they thrived, there were busy schools at both of
the above places filled with their children. After the stumps were
pulled, the crops they planted prospered. They grew general farm
crops, hay, oats, buckwheat, and cattle as well as, in at least one
case, wagonloads of watermelons. They could also supplement their
income with work in the mills or cutting and selling the oak,
beech, and maple on their property. (A few produced, what is
reported to have been, excellent moonshine.) But soon the truth
about the sandy soil of the northern uplands became apparent. The
crops dwindled, it is reported that they required 10 acres of
pasture for each cow they owned. By the end of WW I the mills
closed or moved away and as a result most of the families did
also.&lt;br&gt;
When the depression hit in the thirties, the remaining families
gave up the fight and almost all of the lands went back to the
state for unpaid taxes.&lt;br&gt;
Today it is difficult to find any sign of the Hoosier farmers who
tilled this land. Look around you as you drive along the trails,
the evidence of their farm fields can be noted by the absence of
large white pine stumps, partial clearings with stands of second
growth aspens, the occasional apple or pear tree, and maybe a lilac
thicket marking the site where once a farm house stood.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Welcome to our cache! Look around you. Can you spot the Great White Ghost? If not, here are a few hints of what is special about this friendly white giant.
Birch Facts:
Birch is the national symbol of Finland.
MacBeth is from the word birch.
Cattle and deer do not like the taste of birch, so they leave birch trees alone.
The Birch was believed to grow at the Gates of Heaven.
Traditional broomsticks were made of birch.
The birch is associated with the "Northern Lights," and the Birch is ruled by Venus (both the planet and the goddess).
Birch is grown in northern Europe to produce plywood for furniture making.
Birch bark is used for roofing and baskets, because it is water resistant. Birch bark contains a large quantity of resin.
Birch logs will burn when wet.
Yule logs are usually birch.
Birch bark was used for Native American canoes.
In Sweden and Lapland birch sap replaces sugar.
A birch switch was used to scourge the back of Christ at the Crucifixion.</groundspeak:long_description>
      <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Look for stumps across from the birch.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Thanks for the cache.  Kind of bittersweet.  I walked from my house while the movers were picking up our stuff to move to Louisiana next week.  Been caching in Michigan since 2005 and this is the first cache that I have found by walking from my house.   I found the cache easily wih my dog, Spot the Geocaching Hound Dog, and signd the log, took nothing and left nothing.  Gonna miss northern Michigan a lot!!!!

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">The trail here was pretty much all downhill (a fact that we would realize a little later on our return trip [:O]) and took us directly into the shadow.  Well it was just a little to the east of us, but close enough.  The nicely hidden container was discovered at 1:40.  While we logged our find a jogger passed by, but paid us little attention and quickly disappeared up the trail.  A weathered tribute? to the Great White Ghost sat silently at its' base keeping an eye on the cache and its finders.  Thanks for the birch facts, too.  TN L-Sig Card</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">A nice and easy walk in the woods of northern Lower Michigan.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Located on the Old Mission Peninsula north of some really nice restaurants, taverns, and wineries, that locals know but are rarely frequented by visitors.   The coordinates of some of these may be in the cache.
&lt;P&gt;
There are some foxes in these woods.  I hope you spot one.
&lt;P&gt;
There are marked pathways to keep the area accessible and generally undisturbed. The paths are marked with "You are here" maps at crossroads.  You won't get lost.  There are some of the oldest and largest pine trees in the state in this township park.  Stop and look at some of these giants and try to think of a time when ALL the trees in the state were that big.  
&lt;P&gt;
The parking lot is located at N 44° 59.423 - W 085° 28.815.  Head SOUTH, past the war monument to find the path.
&lt;P&gt;
There are no surprises in the cache.  Please hide it as well as you found it so hikers and X-C skiers  won't bother it.
&lt;P&gt;
Later, I will add some coordinates of some other places of interest on the OM Peninsula.
&lt;P&gt;
There may be new coordinates in the cashe to lead you to a really nice part of the park with a nice view and the trail that from there goes back to the parking lot with a Grand Feature to boot.  If there is no new coordinates, just head EAST and follow the path.
&lt;P&gt;
It's a mile and  a half for the whole loop or you can just return to the parking lot the way that you came.  In the summer, there are not many insects in this area.
&lt;P&gt;
Please DO NOT leave ANY food, drink or  tobacco items. 
&lt;P&gt;
PS. The original spot has been ruined somehow and now the cache is in a new location nearby.  These coordinates are now posted as the real ones for this geocache.  Let me know if you have a better fix on the cache if you think yours are better.  Please replace the cache just as you found it.  That's upside down with the opening DOWN.  It tends to collect moisture if left with the opening up.  Thanks.
&lt;p&gt;
I have replaced the cache in its original location and it's dry now.  Some of the items were missing.  Either they were damaged and removed or stolen by a non-geocacher who found the cache.  Either way,  they're gone.  SORRY!
&lt;p&gt;
***Helpful hint***  Take a pair of channel locks along.  The cache is getting hard to open.

Full disclosure, I'd seen it before.

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">A puzzle involving interpretation of aerial photography</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Finding the location of the "snake eyes" in the aerial
photograph below is the key to solving this geocache puzzle. There
is a small green building immediately to the west of the two round
objects (snake eyes). About 150 feet from this building, bearing
248 degrees, is a small dowel in a treehole upon which are written
the coordinates of the actual cache. The final cache is about 0.6
miles from the "snake eyes." and can be reached by walking or a
combination drive/walk. Once you have the coordinates, the cache
itself will be an easy find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="http://img.groundspeak.com/cache/f5cd5ccf-d542-44f9-af6a-6c9058b33428.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The coordinates above are not for the cache itself.&lt;/b&gt;
Instead, they are for a prominent Grand Traverse Bay area landmark
which is located &lt;b&gt;7.87 miles&lt;/b&gt; (as the crow flies) from the
"snake eyes." This aerial photograph is from TerraServer which
provides aerial images of the continental United States. Use
&lt;a rel="nofollow"
href="http://terraserver.microsoft.com/image.aspx?t=1&amp;amp;s=16&amp;amp;x=48&amp;amp;y=386&amp;amp;z=16&amp;amp;w=1"&gt;
TerraServer&lt;/a&gt; and comparison with appropriate maps and/or your
innate knowledge of the area to solve this puzzle. The "prominent
landmark" is visible from the vicinity of the cache site on a clear
day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This geocache was inspired by &lt;a rel="nofollow"
href="http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=2db14dd0-a2db-423e-b380-fbaf08dd380d"&gt;
GCGPYX&lt;/a&gt; and others like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Satellites have many purposes in addition to providing
navigation, the function we utilize in geocaching. If it is a clear
sunny day when you find this cache, look up into the sky and smile
-- you may be on candid camera!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

driving while speaking Geospeak! This cache is Gemazing! Or
Geotastic! Geonderfull !!(At least he thinks it is.) He is having a
fun time of it today. Don't step on geoooop on your hike. 
&lt;p&gt;Try to speak some Geanguage in your log. Be gelingo and speak
geanguage! It isn't too hard if you bring along a 12 year old
along. Have fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is a small roundish Lock-Tite container with a
TreePlanter Coin for the FTF prize. Bring small items to trade.
Post a geicture of the sites. It is a great area.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">The cache location is across from an old little known cemetery on Old Mission Peninsula.  The cache is a regular size lock n lock container with a few trade Items.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The Greek word Yia Yia means Grandmother in english. Recently two close friends (Knicknames Woo Woo and Lou Lou) lost their Grandmother at the ripe old age of 95. I'm immpressed on how even though they lived some distance apart my friends still made the effort to visit their grandmother when they could. At the same time as I was touched with their loss I realized that my Grandparents where gone before I grew up and I missed out on doing things and creating memories with my Grandparents. This was the inspiration for this cache, so if you still have a Grandmother, get your Yia Yia's out or stop in for a visit. Better yet why not take them Geocaching! 

I'm sure that someone's Grandmother is buried there and please respect this area as if your own Yia Yia was buried there. 

Here is a link for another tidbit about this cemetery,

For the FTF prize there is a 1980 US coin proof set.

Beautiful location for a final resting place!  Picked up the TB that was in the cache and will transport back to NE Oklahoma!

It was an interesting location and appeared to be one family plot and a lone soldiers grave at the location.

When we returned to the car, my wife, son and daughter told us the farmer had come out and told them to move along. If they didn't move he was going to get his tractor and chase them out. We believed them for a few seconds and then realized they were playing a joke on us. It sure made them laugh. HA HA...</groundspeak:text>

&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;img src=

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Lance gave me &lt;b&gt;a four hour head start&lt;/b&gt; and we were required
to stick unerringly to a constant compass bearing regardless of
obstacles encountered. The race started at &lt;b&gt;N 45&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;
04.175', W 085&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; 43.869'&lt;/b&gt; with a swim in Lake
Michigan. Then we had to bushwhack across the Leelanau Peninsula
(on foot or mountain bike), kayak across Grand Traverse Bay (with a
portage of the Peninsula), and finally bushwhack to the race end at
&lt;b&gt;N 44&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; 40.175', W 085&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; 25.869'.&lt;/b&gt; The map
below illustrates the race course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;img src=
"http://img.groundspeak.com/cache/9092eac3-fee0-418c-88c9-71b8943592d5.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, we traveled at constant rates of speed thoughout
the race. Unfortunately, Lance's speed was twice mine and despite
my head start, he won the race. It took him five hours to complete
the course while I completed it in ten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find this cache, you must calculate exactly where Lance
overtook me. To do so, you must perform the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calculate the distance in degrees of the race course using the
Pythagorean Theory (a&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + b&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
- see diagram below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calculate our respective speeds in degrees/hr.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calculate at what point along the race course Lance overtook me
(remember my 4 hr head start).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determine the coordinates for that location (where the geocache
is hidden).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The coordinates at the top of this page are not for the cache
itself.&lt;/b&gt; Instead they are for a convenient parking area not far
from where the geocache is hidden. This is a geometry/algebra
puzzle probably best solved at home before embarking to find the
cache. Conversion of coordinates from hdd.mm.mmm to hdd.ddddd is
useful. If you need help with this puzzle, feel free to send an
email to &lt;a href="mailto:whitard@yahoo.com"&gt;Whitard&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S.&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; did not use performance enhancing
substances!&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">Just off one of the newest trails in the park.  Winter friendly in to around 4 feet of snow.  The closest parking is at the end of the road in the Stormy Weather Cache but not recomended in deep snow.  There are several areas to park and several trails to get to the cache.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The cache container is tubular in shape and can hold a log book and small trade items and travel bugs.  It is white with a layer of natural camoflage.  I will keep this cache active as long as nature can keep up this natural balancing act. I first saw this cache site around a year ago and still wonder each day I see it why it remains in place.  Must have been so I could launch a new cache in the middle of winter.  There are two FTF prizes for whoever decides to venture out in the woods in the wintertime.  Happy Hunting!

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The Bluejay Team has taken over the popular Old Mission
Lighthouse Cache. This was placed by a vacationer from California
who asked for a local cacher to maintain it. We moved the cache
from the poison ivy where it had been and away from a letterbox
which was often mistaken for the cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The container is the same 3" x 4" x 2" box, so it is not exactly
a micro, but can only hold very small items. Basically, just sign
the log book and tell us where you are from!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope you enjoy this beautiful area! You will find Old Mission
Lighthouse, hiking/skiing trails, and the 45th parallel here. First
finder can have a Geocaching.com patch.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">This cache is dedicated to all our Local Farmers.  Stop at one around here or in your own neighborhood.  Around here you can get fresh cherries, apples, tomatoes, wine, maple syrup, and other fruits and vegetables.  Park at N44 58.792 W085 29.432 to be close to your car at the end. The first two stages (the coordinates above are for stage 1) involve 35mm containers with coordinates for stage two and the cache which is a good size lock n lock container.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Sit down on the memorial bench at the coordinates above for stage 1 and see our newest farmers at work.   Besides having a great view, this spot overlooks our newest wind generator.  A new kind of farming that could really change the landscape.  Two years ago I was here just before the wind brought the first generator down.  Reminder that on real windy days in the woods things can fall.  This is the highest  part of the park and is a really good place to watch the sunset or catch a breeze.  

Stage 2 is another 35mm container with coordinates to the final cache which is near an old piece of  farming machinery that one of our local farmers left behind, the inspiration for this cache.  Not sure what it was used for but it looks kind of old.  There are also some big old trees around this area also.

Remember to patronize your Local Farmer, without them we would all go hungry.

Throughout my travels through the trail systems yesterday - I could think of easier ways to complete the stages - but it would take some driving.  However, the scenery was quite impressive.  (There is a letterbox located near stage 1 - for those letterboxers).  I had quite a difficult time retrieving stage 2 - (I'm a little short and that nose has a larger cavity than one would expect.) Some water inside - I dumped it - but coords. readable.  Final in good condition - some mushroomers stumbled upon it before I did (they made a notation in the log and thought 'cachin' sounded fun. That was nice of them to note their discovery and leave as found.)  T Yosemite TB and green boat for Mr Noah, L booklet: Green Living for Dummies (fits with the 'support farmers' to an extent).

&lt;p&gt;One winter, before they even had trails, we decided to do some
exploring here. After walking around, we couldn’t figure out where
we were. Well, turn on the GPSr! To our concern, we discovered that
we had lost it. We wandered around, sure that we would find our way
out. As the darkness and cold settled in, we knew we would have to
spend the night. As the temperature went down to 0 degrees, we sunk
into a numb, almost unconscious state. That’s the last thing we
remember, except for a vague picture of a huge dark form. To our
surprise, we awoke in our car, covered with a blanket we had in the
trunk. We couldn’t understand what had happened, but the trunk was
open and the lock on one door was busted. Before it began snowing
again, we saw huge footprints all around the car. Whatever it was,
it had saved our lives! We decided to put a cache here to trade
emergency items so future ‘cachers would be more prepared. We also
felt ‘cachers should demonstrate their ability to handle this land
by solving puzzles as they went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three puzzles to solve to get to the cache and
complete the 3/4 mile round trip hike/snowshoe. Kids can help! Best
to return to the trail after finding #1 and others. If you really
want to search for Bigfoot, you can take much farther loops around
after finding #2 and before starting to look for #3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="RED"&gt;Copy and take this with you!&lt;/font&gt; At #3:
You will find numbers nearby.&lt;/b&gt; To the north coordinates of #3,
&lt;b&gt;subtract&lt;/b&gt; the result of: Add the bottom two numbers, multiply
this by 3, then add the second number from the top= result. To the
west coordinates, &lt;b&gt;add&lt;/b&gt; the result of: Add up all the numbers
+ 4 = result. This will take you to the final cache.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Well, I don't even really know where to start on this one....  But here goes....  I first did a drive by to scope out the best way in.  I could see that the snow in the drive hadn't been plowed, but it really didn't look that deep.  So I do a U-turn, right there on 115, into where I thought the drive was (under 3 feet of snow that was deceptively deeper than it appeared!).  As soon as the snow stopped me, I knew I was stuck.  Put it in reverse, I'm goin' nowhere...  Drive, nowhere.  I glance over to the Honor State Bank next to the Mish-A-Mish Roadside Park (where I'm stuck) and see a guy looking in my direction, shaking his head, get into his pick-up truck.  He pulls around, turns his 4-ways on and pulls off the road next to me.  I roll down my window as he walks up and he says, "I seen whatcha done there!  ...you stuck?"  All I could say was, "Yup!"  He informed me that he had a tow rope and for me to sit tight and he'd have me pulled outta there in no time.  He was the kindest man....  and my God-sent guardian angel!  He did pull my van out of the snow and I was on my way in no time!  Either way, I decided maybe (just maybe) this wasn't a winter-friendly cache and to let it be.  

**Check out the pictures of the snow, after I got pulled out.**

When I was in the area again about a week later with my son, it was getting dark and we decided not to make the walk thru the woods in the dark so passed it again.  Today as we headed out during the Turkey Trot, we finally had the time, a beautiful day and are happy to add a smiley to this cache.  Thanks so much for placing this series all over up here.

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">A larger and more remote version of my Hook Line &amp; Sinker caches.  The terrain rating can differ depending on the way you go in.  If you go a little further east of where the cache is you can have a treetop view of the East Bay.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">I would suggest you try my other nearby cache Nature's Delicate Balancing Act on your way to this cache for the best approach, nearby deer trail (aprox 1500 ft northeast of the cache along the ridge) will minimize bush whacking.  The terrain rating can be higher with a different approach.  Some of the items on the cache glow in the dark.  If you see a 17 ft white with blue top Starcraft Boat Salmon fishing on the east bay, wave to Squidriggens!

Also you may want to keep curious geodogs on a leash, I came across a porcupine and deer while placing this cache

The FTF prize is a 1992 US Coin Mint Set!

This was totally amazing and we both really enjoyed your cache.  
On the way out we found a blood trail and the foot prints of the hunter following them.  </groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Armed with a suggestion from cache owner, we hiked into this cache from Nature's Balancing Act - better trail.  Still slight bushwhacking but better than the little trail that we tried last Spring.  Almost stepped on 2 ?porcupine or skunk carcasses buried amongst the crunchy leaves.  Made a circle with the coords and spied from several feet away when Noah was checking another possible hiding spot.  Once again, good to have him along - I needed some extra arms.  Noah T a paper airplane and L a little blue dolphin keychain - the most appropriate swag in our pack for this cache.  TFTC. (And the better way to journey into it.).</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Talk about taking the tough way in.  We didn't read the description that well and missed the deer path.  After wandering around the trails and bumping into a well behaved porcupine we found ourselves at a range of 450 feet and staring up a rather steep hill.  Not to be detered we clawed (and I do mean clawed) our way up the hill, doing more tree climbing to get up than actual walking and after catching our breath once on top found the cache.  Great cache, great idea, TNLNSL.  I earned my beer for the day on this one! KSprig with us on the mountain climb and find!</groundspeak:text>

We were using my car Garmin and the batteries were running out.  We had no idea where we were or where are car was, and we kept running into this ravine we had to go around.  We finally found our way back and have vowed to buy a hand-held GPS with terrain info before our next woods experience.  Even though we didn't find this one, we are "hooked" on this activity.</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Out grabbing some of the local TC caches before heading home later today. Parked off of Bunker Hill Road to start my tour thru this great parkland. Well this one was interesting. Hiked along the creek at the dry line. Wasn't sure which side of the creek  to be on so I crosseed a log "bridge" over, hiked a bit, than reassessed the situation and re-crossed. Continued on when I came across a "better bridge". Crossed it and headed for GZ. Couldn't get closer the 38 feet so I searhced  a bit as I did not want to cross again after returning to the other side. Returned to the other side, walked the GPS down to zero, looked there, than stepped back scanned the area and finally spotted the hide. This was a lot of fun. Thanks for the challenge! 3rd of 6 here. #6752 11:55am 7 of 25 TFTC.

      </groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Please read &amp; print off this page - it will make hiking this unique path more enjoyable.  Also, it might be beneficial to print off the trail map for this park.  It can be found at the web site listed above under the cache ratings.

This cache is hidden along a well-trod deer path.  The path will take you along a part of the Peninsula Township Park that is not often seen from the major trails.  You will see breath taking views of the bay, stunning cliffs, and an assortment of wildlife:  deer, fox, racoon, etc.

However, this cache is not for everyone (please see the attributes).  The path is easily followed and mostly flat, but it does traverse along the top of a cliff ridge and at places has some exposed tree roots, rocks, and/or small fallen trees that need to be stepped over.

You will start your hike at the parking lot on Old Mission Peninsula at the end of Ridgewood Rd.  At the parking lot, please take a good look at the trail map listed (or look at the one you printed off from the web site).  It is impossible to get truly lost in this park system, but we want you to have fun finding this cache and not have to worry about where you are.

Looking at the trail map, you will be hiking parallel to trail number 7, but in the woods next to East Bay.  You will end at the trail head marked 6 on the map.  The total round trip will be between 2.5 - 4 miles, depending on which way you choose to finish the hike after finding the cache.

Heading up the main trail, about a 1/4 mile along, you will find a deer path on the right, about 10 feet south of the numbered telephone pole.  The coordinates are indicated in the additional waypoints listed - it might be advisable to plug these into your GPS.

This deer path will take you through some meadowlands and sumac forest, but is easily traveled, no bushwacking required.  After the sumac bushes, the path emerges into the woods and you start walking along the ridge of the cliff.

After approximately 1.12 miles, the path will split.  These coordinates are also listed below.  There will be a large tree on the left side of the path.  Do NOT take the downhill path, as this will lead you off into the wild blue yonder.  Look around behind the tree and you will see the left fork of this path.  Follow this along the ravine.  Your GPS should also tell you if you are going in the right direction - I had good satellite reads here, surprisingly.  You will follow this new path to the cache.

Getting out of the Back Country!  You have 3 options.  Option 1 = go back the way you came.  Option 2 = bushwack directly west from the cache for about 1/4 mile until you hit the main trail (#7).  Turn left onto trail #7 and you have about 1/2 mile back to the parking lot. Option 2 is not necessarily recommended because of all the thistle plants &amp; burrs, but it gets you back to the main trail relatively quickly.  Option 3 is the preferred method = keep going along the path.  The path will once again fork, but go to the left (the right hand fork will take you to the lighthouse if you are interested in an extremely LONG hike).  You will very shortly end up at the #6 trailhead marker.  Take a left turn onto the main trail &amp; you have about 3/4 mile to go until the parking lot.  There is also another trail map posted at the #6 trailhead.

It was a GREAT walk along the lakeshore bluff.  The deer trail was very prominate.  Cut across to the west to hit the trail out.  Were glad we did Nature's Delicate Balancing Act first, it was for sure the best way in here.  We got about 3/4 of the way to the cache, when Monkey Man's batteries started to poop out.........so we turned one of the GPS's off just in case.  Wouldn't you know it a previous cacher left fresh batteries in the cache!  THANK YOU!  We will definitely pay this one forward.  We probably had 3 dozen batteries in the car!  We really enjoyed the walk, and got our exercise for the day.  T-batteries L-Bug Wipes &amp; Wet Wipes  TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">What a great cache!  I almost attempted to find this cache back when the snow cover was a couple feet high but did not after emailing the cache owner and finding out the container was plastic.  I kind have my own policy of finding caches in the winter time in remote areas by snow shoeing and bringing along a metal detector.  Today, with almost no snow on the ground I parked my jeep about 0.60 of a mile directly east of the cache.  With Spot the Geocaching Hound Dog, man’s best friend, we set off for the cache and found it relatively easy after passing the first stage to “Farmer’s Cache” along the way.  This was the perfect time of the year to bushwhack, because there were no bushes to whack.  At ground zero, I recognized a trail near the cache that I took back from finding another nearby cache (Old Mission Bed and Breakfast) a few years ago.  Once again, I have found all of the existing caches on Old Mission peninsula and am eagerly waiting for more to be placed!

Signed the log book, took a National Rifle Association medallion to give to TheWaypointKid and left nothing.

You will find monuments written in Polish and German in this cemetery. My personal favorites are the ones made of bronze. There are several in this cemetery from the 1880's, but the writing is very visible. I wonder why not many were made of this material. Notice the names of the roads in the area, and you will find monuments here for those people.

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">Enjoy the scenic drive on M-37 along vineyards and orchards till you reach the tip of the Old Mission Peninsula.  At the end of M-37 you will find parking at N 44 59.423  W 085 28.815  The cache is about 1.43 miles (direct route) from the parking lot.  The cache is a regular size ammo box located near the shoreline on the East Bay.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">To avoid a higher terrain rating (BIG HILL) I would suggest you try GCWTPE Stormy Weather cache on the way in and hike south along the shoreline.  There are many glacial rocks along this route that you can enjoy on your hike. I found this structure last spring while hunting for those famous Morrel mushrooms.  It consists of four cement walls with three window openings and a doorway and no roof overhead.  Modern day conveniences include a central heating cooking area (fire pit) along with two plywood sheet beds that sit up on rocks.  The walls look like they were made over a period of time evidenced by the lines and layers in the concrete walls.  My guess, is that it was a local farmers cottage on  the bay un till it was turned into part of the park lands.  

The cache is filled with nice trading items.  First to Find Prize is a 1984 United States Coin Proof Set.

I hope you enjoy your visit to this great place and your stay at the Old Mission Bed &amp; Breakfast.

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">The cache is a small Lock and Lock plastic box big enough to hold a sandwich.  It is located in the Old Mission Township Park at the tip of Old Mission Peninsula.  The cache has been disguised and camoflaged so that it will hopefully make this a little more challenging to find than the usual "box in the woods" cache.  Please restore the camoflage when you are done.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">I created this cache for my nephews, who live on Old Mission peninsula.  They have often gone cache hunting with me when we visit the area, and I hope to put at least one other cache in the area soon.  The actual lock and lock box is not huge, so smaller trade items are the rule here.  

You can get to this cache in two ways - first, park in the parking lot near the lighthouse and hike in.  The trails are marked, and maps are usually available at the trailhead.  Or you can drive in on the fire trail, and park about 400-500 feet away from the cache.  The hike would be much more enjoyable, though.  In the winter, this could be a great cache to do on XC skis.

I do *NOT* recommend you even consider driving in during the winter, or if the fire trail is soft and muddy.  The drive is about a mile long over a narrow 2-track road.  If you get stuck back here, the towing bill to get you out will be enormous!

The entrance to the fire trail is at N 44 59.230, W 085 29.665.  The place to park is at the end of this trail, at N 44 59.232, W 085 28.485.  This parking area is little more than enough room to turn around.</groundspeak:long_description>

This was the first time for Mrs. Mountaineer to see this type of hide.  I didn't say a word and watched her.  She stared at it and I could not help myself and I started busting up.  She attempted to remove it but it was frozen and then she slipped and feel knocking it over and then it opened.  I wish you all could have seen this happen.  This made for a perfect day of geocaching and a memorial moment.  </groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">Take 37 (center road) all the way to the end and park at the lighthouse.  A round trip to the cache from the parking lot will be a little over a mile.  The cache is a small Lock in Lock container with a log book and a few trinkets.  The cache is not in the water as the map shows.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This cache is very similar to the Seagull's Misery cache here in this park.  I would not recommend this cache on certain days, in the spring and summer you will be attacked by lots and lots of bugs, they start around the time the Barn Swallows migrate back to the park.  On some days it will look like smoke  or haze above the road leading into the light house because the swarms of newly hatched bugs is so thick.  Another consideration will be future water levels which are unpredictable.  The terrain is relatively flat, but can have issues like slimly mucky areas that are hard to avoid.  The terrain is rated higher for some of these reasons, besides the fact that there are a lot of rocks.  In mucky areas I suggest using these rocks when present as stepping stones.  

  I've been eyeing this piece of land for quite a while for a new cache at the most northern point on Old Mission Peninsula, but every time there seems to be a muggle around.  The last time, half way out, I see a fisherman was at the end of the line.  Yesterday,  I made the hike down the trail and found a neat spot for a cache.  There are many rocks in the area, a few of them are very large interesting specimens.  The best time to do this one is like yesterday, strong northerly winds with large breakers meeting at the end of land and start of an under water point.  The sound is spectacular on windy days, as well as the view.  You can also get a good long shot of the lighthouse from here.  The spoiler should give it away, please place cache back the way you found it or better.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">A former center of the northern Michigan lumber and furniture trade, Arcadia is the hometown of the first American aviatrix, Harriet Quimby (although she reportedly refused to admit it) and Arcadia Lake, formerly known as Bar Lake due to the fact that it is separated from Lake Michigan by a large sandbar.

This cache will bring you to the former site of the Starke Land and Lumber Company sawmill and, after it burned in 1906, the Arcadia Furniture Company. In its heyday in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Arcadia Lake harbor was host to over 500 large vessels a year, mostly carrying lumber and passengers. Lack of funding caused the harbor to deteriorate, however, and commerce slowed along with the shipping traffic. By the middle of the twentieth century, the furniture factory and the harbor were closed.

Arcadia Lake has since seen a revival and this cache will bring you to a small park that will allow you a great view of the lake and perhaps some of the fishing boats that now use the marina.

Parking is close. This is a log-only cache, so bring your own pen.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">Another fun combination of geometry, mathematics, and nature near
Traverse City
</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Clyde, a barnstormer, wants to perform his daredevil stunts and
aerobatics but flight controllers understandably don't want him
endangering aviation in the vicinity of Cherry Capital Airport.
Therefore, they have directed him to take off from Cherry Capital
(N 44 44.656, W 085 34.433) and to ascend at a constant angle and
heading until he reaches an altitude of 2400 meters at a location
northeast of Traverse City. At that point (which happens to be
directly over the Barnstormers geocache!) he is free to begin his
antics. As Clyde ascends enroute his performance, he notices that
he reaches an altitude of 800 meters exactly over location N 44
46.104, W 085 32.178. Clyde's general route is shown below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;img src=
"http://img.groundspeak.com/cache/f3450ba3-496d-41ea-b696-b617ef52d1f9.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The geocache is located at the point exactly 2400 meters below
where Clyde is permitted to begin his performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;img src=
"http://img.groundspeak.com/cache/56f26060-444d-42ca-a075-69c09dd90d49.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As illustrated above, this puzzle can be solved using principles
of similar triangles. For the purposes of this exercise consider
the earth flat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

     "http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Explorers_Record_Setters_and_Daredevils/barnstormers/EX12.htm"&gt;
Barnstormers&lt;/a&gt; were the extreme sports practitioners of their day
(mainly in the 1920's) and performed all sorts of amazing
aerobatics and stunts (such as wing walking and transfers between
planes in flight). Clyde Pangborn (pictured at left) was one of the
most famous of the breed. Later in his career he made the first
nonstop trans-Pacific flight from Japan to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The area in which the geocache is hidden is a beautiful,
probably lesser known, nature area. As befits a cache dedicated to
flight, at the time the cache was placed there were an eagles nest
and two roosting bald eagles in the distance at bearing 170 degrees
from the cache location. Finders of the cache are to trade aviation
related items, but as always, any geotrade items are welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The coordinates at the top of this page are not for the
cache, but are for a nearby place in which to park and access the
area.&lt;/b&gt; If you have trouble figuring this one out, feel free to
contact &lt;a href="mailto:whitard@yahoo.com"&gt;Whitard&lt;/a&gt; for some
help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have fun with his geometry/mathematics problem and this
beautiful nature area!&lt;/p&gt;

Unfortunately I didn't have my notes with me, and ignoring my own geo-sense, it seemed as some degree of significant figures put me a few dozen feet away from ground zero.

Finally, NoSuchCache got tired of watching the silliness and listened to her own geo-sense (which happened to agree with my previous ideas).  She smacked me upside the head and, GPS aside, we had the cache in-hand not long afterwards.  Without her "sense," I might still be looking for this one!

Saw the eagles as I was at the other cache.  The cache is in good shape and made it through the winter just fine. Found it at 3:05pm for our 3rd find of the day.  Thanks for the cache!.

&lt;p&gt;No tricks, no puzzles, but a bit of a walk (maybe one and a
quarter miles the way I did it) to Ptobego Pond. Park at the Maple
Bay Nature Area (turn off US 31 at N 44 50.584, W 085 26.764) and
head through beautiful woodlands straight to the beach. Head north
staying on the high waterline as you pass private property to get
to the area of the cache (on public land). You will have to wade
the shallow outlet of Ptobego Pond as you approach the cache which
is amidst the dunes on an isthmus between Grand Traverse Bay and
Ptobego Pond. The cache is an ammunition box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There seems to be no end to these beautiful nature preserves in
the Grand Traverse Bay area. We are very fortunate. Take your time
and enjoy the views.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;PPW0GW - Highway 31 Turn Off&lt;br /&gt;N 44° 50.584 W 085° 26.764&lt;br /&gt;Access Maple Bay Nature Area parking at this turn off from U.S. 31.&lt;br /&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

We took a nice long walk through the woods and along the beach to get to the cache.  Got there and were sad to see the cache contents laying on the ground, but the cache container missing.  There were two previous entries that mention the missing container, but these were never logged online.

Thanks for placing a cache in this great location.  Enjoyed the area.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;b&gt;DISCLAIMER&lt;/b&gt; This cache is not for everyone. We placed it
because we like the drive and we like the history. It won’t fit on
your Palm, you need to print it out, all 5 pages of the
description. It involves about 40 miles of driving and contains 17
stages. If that’s not your style, don’t do it. Put it on your
ignore list or if you want the Smilie without the Mickey Mouse,
email us and we’ll give you the cords. It does show you some great
views and will take you in close proximity to 13 other caches and 5
letterboxes. You should print out the letterboxes pages too, they
contain some legends and history. If you haven't done a letterbox
before, it's kind of a non tech geocache. 
&lt;p&gt;Following the removal of the Native Americans, caused because as
non-citizens, they could not obtain title to the land, this area
became a land of farms and summer homes. The agriculture was mixed
with a gradual and growing emphasis on fruit. The homes for the
most part were summer retreats for wealthy and upper middle class
vacationers mainly from Chicago and Cincinnati.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;b&gt;A = _____ N44° 46.463, W085° 35.460&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Your first stop is at the blinker light marking the junction of M37
and Peninsula Drive, turn left and pull to the side, find a
memorial plaque and count the number of letters in the woman’s
first name, the result is A. (We will find out about Archie in just
a little while)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;B = _____N44° 48.312, W085° 34.875&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Continue up Peninsula Dr. to your next stop. This route follows the
original Indian trail along the beach. First settlers described it
as a well trod narrow foot path. For that reason, most
transportation was by water. Later this route became the
fashionable location for summer cottages. Now it sports some of the
area’s latest and greatest McMansions.&lt;br&gt;
Please obey the 35 MPH speed limit, gawk all you want but keep an
eye out for bikes and pedestrians. At your second stop, &lt;b&gt;(2.18
miles)&lt;/b&gt; the third digit in the address of the apartments on your
right is B.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;C = _____N44° 50.086, W085° 32.358&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Continue north to Wilson Rd. &lt;b&gt;(1.18 miles)&lt;/b&gt; and turn right.
When you reach the stop sign &lt;b&gt;(.84 miles)&lt;/b&gt; turn left on Center
Rd./M37 and proceed north to the roadside park. &lt;b&gt;(1.35 miles)&lt;/b&gt;
This is the site of a ghost town. Read the plaque find the last
digit of the year the Post Office closed, this number is C.&lt;br&gt;

Go back out on Center Rd, drive north .2 miles, turn left on Gray
Rd and return to Peninsula Dr. &lt;b&gt;(1.3 miles)&lt;/b&gt; Continue north to
your next stop. &lt;b&gt;(4 miles)&lt;/b&gt; On your way you will pass Nelson
Road.&lt;b&gt;1.8 miles&lt;/b&gt; There is a cache a short drive to the east.

This building was the summer home of a wealthy Chicago lumberman
J.W. Stickney and his wife Genevieve. There is a story that she
hung herself here but in fact she died in Grand Rapids. It is true
that this was “her house” and upon his death, J.W. passed the
property on to his “nurse”. Outraged perhaps, it is said that her
ghost haunts the structure still. Here is the legend and a
letterbox description, &lt;a rel="nofollow" href=
"http://www.stampinthebox.com/clues/bowers.asp"&gt;The Ghost of Bowers
Harbor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 The number repeated in the address is D&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;E = _____N44° 53.685, W085° 31.505&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
After driving a short distance further north, &lt;b&gt;(.8 miles)&lt;/b&gt;you
pass through the remains of the once bustling village of Bowers
Harbor. The restaurant on your left was once the general store. A
man named Bower who was fleeing the despotical “King Strang” of
Beaver Island established the community. The unusual structure on
the NE corner of the intersection was built as a cherry receiving
station. Here farmers would unload freshly picked fruit in boxes
called lugs. The fruit was weighed on the spot and then trucked to
the cannery in Traverse City. Today it is a Michigan Historic site
and is used as a flower stand.&lt;br&gt;
Turn left on Neahtawanta Road and enter the boat launch. There you
will find a plaque commemorating the earliest accomplishment of a
man who lived to be a leading citizen and historian/photographer of
the region. Calculate his age at the time of his birthday at the
time of this event. Add the digits of his age. That number is E.
There is a cache here &lt;a rel="nofollow" href=

&lt;b&gt;F = _____N44° 54.057, W085° 32.922&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Turn left out of the boat launch and continue west on Neahtawanta
Rd. Soon you will pass the access road to Pyatt Lake. &lt;b&gt;(.3
miles)&lt;/b&gt; There are two caches there, &lt;a rel="nofollow" href=

GCQ42T.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
As you approach Kroupa Road, notice the farm on the northeast
corner. It is the original Kroupa homestead and the barn built of
rough-hewn logs is the oldest remaining in the county. On the NW
corner is the Bowers Harbor School. At one time there were 9
one-room schools on the Peninsula. In 1954 they were consolidated
and merged with the Traverse Area Public School system and replaced
by the modern Old Mission School. The buildings have all been
converted into private homes or businesses.&lt;br&gt;
Your next stop is the Bohemian Cemetery. &lt;b&gt;(1.2 miles)&lt;/b&gt; Note
the preponderance of the Kroupa name. It was and is one of the
prominent names in Peninsula history. Find the unusual grave marker
for John and Anna Hajcek. The number of branch stumps is F. The
previously linked Letterbox is located here.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;G = _____N44° 53.685, W085° 33.108&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Continue on west to the end of the pavement at the Neahtawanta Inn.
&lt;b&gt;(.5)&lt;/b&gt; The name was given this resort settlement by the
members of the Universalist Church from Cincinnati who established
it in the late 19th century.. They thought it meant “I’m going to
visit for a while” in the Ottawa language. The vacationers traveled
by train to Traverse and then by steamer to the docks they built
here. Originally there was a three story hotel up on the hill which
provided meals and housing for guests.&lt;br&gt;
This rambling structure in front of you grew under the ownership of
a local girl, Mary Kroupa Atherton, who opened a small guest
cottage in 1906. It was expanded after the hotel burned in 1913.
She continued to operate the Inn as a guesthouse as well as
replacing the hotel as a dining hall for nearby cottages until her
death at the age of 99. Today it operates as a Bed and
Breakfast.&lt;br&gt;
 The third digit in the address is G&lt;br&gt;
Despite the ominous warning signs, continue on for a short distance
if you are so inclined. This is an area of Victorian cottages
reminiscent of Bay View near Petoskey. Past the cottages is an area
of newer residences. It the 50’s this area was much used by
teenagers for beach parties. Perhaps that’s the reason for the
signs.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;H = _____N44° 55.275, W085° 30.986&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Returning on Neahawanta Drive, turn left on Kroupa Rd. &lt;b&gt;(.8
miles)&lt;/b&gt; This road will give you an up close look at both sweet
and tart cherry orchards.&lt;br&gt;
 Continue on Kroupa to your next stop. &lt;b&gt;(2.6 miles)&lt;/b&gt; At one
time there were many large canneries in Traverse City and quite a
number of receiving and processing stations on the Peninsula. They
provided summer employment for many teens and college students in
the area. This one covered the cache owners’ tuition. On your tour
you will pass quite a few of their abandoned structures. Today this
business is the last large processing plant here. It is one of the
nation's largest producers of the base stock for Maraschino
cherries.&lt;br&gt;
Subtracting the first digit of the address from the second will
give you H&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;I = _____ N44° 55.190, W085° 30.127&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Proceed to the end of Kroupa Rd &lt;b&gt;(.5 miles)&lt;/b&gt; and turn right on
Center Rd, about a thousand feet south, turn left into the
vineyards of Chateau Chantal. The grape is the fruit that is
replacing apples and cherries as a major crop today. There are now
many vineyards on the Peninsula with five that include bottling
operations and tasting rooms. This winery is the producer of the
soon to be famous &lt;b&gt;“Basswood Bend’s MiGO Red”&lt;/b&gt; and
&lt;b&gt;“Basswood Bend’s Friendly White”&lt;/b&gt;. It is also the highest
point on the Peninsula and possesses the finest views.&lt;br&gt;
Locate the number over the door; the second digit is I.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;J=_____N44° 55.687, W085° 30.178&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Return to Center Rd and continue north. Your next stop is in the
Ogdensburg Cemetery. &lt;b&gt;(.7 miles)&lt;/b&gt; It and the Methodist Church
are all that remain of this community established by settlers from
New York. As you drive through the cemetery, notice the Lardie
name. It is another prominent local family. Here is the most
unusual marker memorializing the brief life of Zachary Andrus. The
digit repeated 5 times is J. On your short journey you will see the
names of many more of the area’s settlers.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;K=_____N44° 56.926, W085° 29.219&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Turn right (east) on Ladd Rd &lt;b&gt;(.3 miles)&lt;/b&gt; and then left on
Smokey Hollow Rd. &lt;b&gt;(1.6 miles)&lt;/b&gt; This stop is shrouded in
controversy. Did the famous American General, Douglas MacArthur
live here? It is true that his first wife, Louise Cromwell Brooks,
owned the property but there is no solid evidence that he ever
visited. He met the rich, young, divorcee in the fall of 1921 when
he was serving as the 41 year old Superintendent of West Point.
Thus, there is no reason to suppose that he visited as a boy. She
is described as the quintessential 20’s “Flapper”. After two
meetings he proposed, she said yes, and they were married at her
stepfathers Palm Beach Fl. mansion the following Valentines Day.
With in two weeks, General “Black Jack” Pershing, reputed to be a
lover/suitor of the fair damsel, had the young groom transferred to
the Philippines. MacArthur always claimed it was done for spite.
For whatever reason the whirlwind romance resulted in a divorce
after only seven years.&lt;br&gt;
The first digit of the address is K&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;b&gt;L=_____N44° 57.245, W085° 29.399&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Pull up to the corner &lt;b&gt;(.2 miles)&lt;/b&gt; and turn right on Mission
Road &lt;b&gt;(.2 miles)&lt;/b&gt; to your next stop. This is the Old Mission
General Store and Post Office. Established in1839, it has been in
operation continuously ever since. Long known as the “Lardie
Store”, it is a great stop for ice cream, “penny candy”, snacks and
chuckles.&lt;br&gt;
The first digit in the address is L&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;M=_____N44° 57.317, W085° 29.376&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Your next stop is the replica of the Old Mission located just up
the street. The mission was established by Peter Dougherty to serve
the settlement of Chippewa and Ottawa who lived in bark wigwams on
the bay. The mission was moved across West Bay to Omena in 1852.
Thus when that settlement became the New Mission, this one was
referred to as Old Mission. The building is open in the summer and
contains an interesting display of local history..&lt;br&gt;
The third digit of the date on the plaque out front is M.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;N=_____N44° 57.726 W085° 29.062&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Continue north on mission Rd toward Swaney Rd &lt;b&gt;(.4 miles)&lt;/b&gt;
Look to your left in about 1000 feet. The white house was the
Dougherty home. It was built with the help of the Indians in 1842.
It was the first frame house in the area. Currently it is
unoccupied and owned by the Township. A fund raising drive is under
way to restore it and open it as a museum. There is a cache here.
&lt;a rel="nofollow" href=

GCZYHT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Turn right on Swaney and drive to Haserot Beach &lt;b&gt;(.2 miles)&lt;/b&gt;
Here you must read the plaques and find the number of different
steamship lines that served this village in its heyday. That number
is N&lt;br&gt;
 Now you have a choice of routes, if you wish to simply finish this
quest on paved roads, go east on Swaney to M37 and the final stop
is 2 ½ miles north. If however you wish to further explore the
area, drive a two track and hunt a couple more caches and a
letterbox, head north on Eastern Rd to Woodland &lt;b&gt;(.2)&lt;/b&gt;. Here
you can continue north and then west on Ridgewood to this cache,
&lt;a rel="nofollow" href=

GCKRG0&lt;/a&gt; and return , or just turn west to Brinkman &lt;b&gt;(.2)&lt;/b&gt;
and north &lt;b&gt;(.9)&lt;/b&gt; to Murray. Turn left and you will see the
parking lot for this cache, &lt;a rel="nofollow" href=

&lt;a rel="nofollow" href=
"http://www.stampinthebox.com/clues/wegaus.asp"&gt;letter box&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 Continue west to the stop sign, &lt;b&gt;(.2)&lt;/b&gt; and then north on
Eagle Ridge until it joins M37. The parking lot is a short distance
east. There are 6 caches in the area, &lt;a rel="nofollow" href=

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Victory!!!!  I can finally relax now.  I've been wanting to complete this cache for 6 months now;  just don't come near TC any more than I have to during the summer months.  This was a fabulous cache - easy and showed a cacher a beautiful tour of Mission Peninsula.  I started this cache Mother's Day weekend on a solo caching weekend and decided this was the day to try to finish it before the snow comes.  We were able to find a good parking spot roughly 500 ft. from the cache and then the real challenge began - the hill.  Of course there are other, maybe easier ways to get here - you just need to know the trail system.  By the way - the trail systems in the park are great for hiking, sight seeing and spending a great day outside.  (Today was a great day for November hiking - mild with a little breeze.)  Coords were good and cache was found easily.  L a frisbee and Mr. Noah chose the scrap of bubble wrap.  Thank you for the great tour of Mission Peninsula!  Thank you for the cache.  </groundspeak:text>

We had another beautiful drive and found several other caches while there as well as getting our smiley for this one... Thank you for all the work and for keeping this one up and running..

We opted for the long climb, made it up that enormous hill, and then to ground zero.  Then the problem was coming down the steep hill, thank goodness I had a walking stick.

Son and D-I-L were here for the weekend, so we tackled it yesterday.  Very nice cache and we found that going past designated parking and valley to top of hill there is plenty of parking and going down that way the creek is not a problem.  I have biked, hiked, skied this area since 1972. Many thanks for a great job.

     coordinates, but they will get you to where you &lt;b&gt;NEED&lt;/b&gt; to
     go.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">We have always liked this park and had the first cache placed here
in 2003. The park offers lots of fun: tennis, baseball, soccer,
basketball, cross-country skiing, skateboarding, hiking trails, a
great sledding hill, and now, pickleball. 
&lt;p&gt;Since this is a special park, we expect all 'cachers to memorize
these rules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No cutting wood for your fireplace&lt;br /&gt;
 No collecting wildflowers&lt;br /&gt;
No removal of tree bark&lt;br /&gt;
Leave your four wheelers at home&lt;br /&gt;
 No snowmobiles allowed&lt;br /&gt;
 No campfires&lt;br /&gt;
 Pets allowed on a leash&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AND also remember this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't get drunk here - zero tolerance is the rule&lt;br /&gt;
 We don't want your garbage here&lt;br /&gt;
 Leave your boom box at home&lt;br /&gt;
Put those matches out cold&lt;br /&gt;
 No winos allowed - remember, zero tolerance&lt;br /&gt;
 Leave the baby pine trees here&lt;br /&gt;
Do not blow your fancy car horn here&lt;br /&gt;
 Don't shoot anything&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After you get the rules memorized,(or okay,you can just
&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="FF0000"&gt;print them out&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and take them
with you!), you will be allowed in the park to participate in
geocaching exercise. And, oh by the way, HAVE FUN !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;August 2008:&lt;/b&gt; Since this has been out for a year and driven
some of you crazy, we are going to give you another hint.</groundspeak:long_description>

We took the trails, but ended up bushwacking further than we needed to. Then the find was quite difficult. Once we found the spot, but didn't dig hard enough to get the container. We came back to that spot and realized our error, but we couldn't imagine sliding into this one during the winter and being able to find it. Also our GPSr might be angry with us because a couple other caches nearby were showing us off by about 60ft even with good accuracy. This one said we were 60 ft NW of the cache when we found it. 

This does look like a great park, and it is close to our grandparents house, and another family favorite - Arbutis Lake. We hope to return some day and check out the XC skiing in the area. TFTC</groundspeak:text>

TRAILS&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Michigan Shore-To-Shore Trail begins at Lake Michigan in Empire
and ends more than 200 miles east at Lake Huron near Oscoda.The
trail was created and is maintained by the Michigan Trail Riders
Association in cooperation with the DNR. It passes through meadows
and forests where possible and uses roadside shoulders and two
tracks where necessary. This section traverses the Boardman River
valley on a series of two tracks and appears to be little used. It
tends to have deep snow in the winter and to be very dry in the
summer. None the less, because we assisted in the creation of the
S2S series, it is one of our favorite area trails. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4" face="Times" color="red"&gt;It is not necessary to
jump through the sticker/pamphlet hoops to log this
cache.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
We got the idea for our Trekking Traverse Trails series from a
similar series in Florida. As a reward for the first 50 who wish
one and who complete the series, we have created a Path Tag on
which is the Traverse City logo. To acquire a tag, stop at the
Traverse City Visitors Center(
&lt;a href="http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=70e9c579-f72c-44c7-a0c3-b06d5830fd3b"&gt;
GC17HZ4&lt;/a&gt;), and pick up a free Trekking Traverse Trails
brochure.&lt;br /&gt;
In each cache container you will find a sticker for that cache.
Paste each of the ten stickers in the brochure, mail it in, and we
will sent you your tag.

This was our first cache of the day and our seventh Trekking Traverse Trails sticker overall. Just three more caches and we win. It was a pretty quick park and grab. We left a little Ktulu, took nothing and we were on our way. Thanks for the cache basswoodbend.</groundspeak:text>

I did find it but only AFTER finding the cache. Let me tell you how thick and nasty that land in between where we parked and the cache itself really is. The trail itself was obvious on the way OUT. I did find some Morels and some other mushrooms that I was not familar with on the way out. Thanks for the adventure (both ways) Tree Toad, Scooter and Riley.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Welcome to our first cache!  We are sailors, and have been sailing for some time on the Great Lakes.  We love to race, and compete each year in the Chicago to Mackinac race.  As a result of our love for the sport, we have designed our cache with sailing in mind.  Included in our cache is a variety of items related to our sport, in addition to a great 'learn to sail' book from the Offshore Sailing School.  Someone, hopefully, will pick up this book and decide to try something new.  

The contents of the cache are as follows:

Basic Sailing Book (to share our sport)
2004 and 2006 Chicago to Mackinac Yacht Race patches
Racquet Ball and Tennis Ball (compliments of our dog)
Bite Lite (used during our racing at night - it's red)
Suunto Coat Compass and Thermometer
Marvyn the Martian pencil
Fish Lure Flashlight.

As a 'first to find' goodie, there is a $5 Quiznos gift card included in our cache.  Have a small lunch on us.

We've done well in our past sailing events.  Our crew has placed in the top 2 competitors in our class for the past 3 out of 4 years.  With 2008 marking the 100th running of the Chicago to Mackinac Yacht Race, it will be the one to watch.  Each boat carries a GPS transponder unit, and you can watch all the teams compete up Lake Michigan.

Enjoy the cache, and be sure to log your information in our book.

      given to the many big and little hands that would keep on
      ticking.&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="brown"&gt;Sooooo, now is your chance for a timely
trade (batteries not included). All of these watched DO work, so
please, let's NOT make this a graveyard for dead clocks!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="brown"&gt;Time's a wasting, so get ticking and watch
the fun begin! This cache is in a beautiful area, and please do
take the time to walk around the trails! If it's wet, bring boots,
if it's buggy bring DEET, if it's cold, dress warm. This area has
an abundance of lopra and fauna, so take your time and please enjoy
responsibly!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Al Quacka&lt;/a&gt; entomologists, virologists and molecular biologists
to conduct the West Nile Virus Project. Three questions are to be
answered:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Why is this virus so far from home?--after all, the Nile is
at approximately N30, E31.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. If there is a West Nile Virus, is there also an East Nile
Virus?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Can Al Quacka bioengineer the West Nile Virus to become a
true W.M.D. (Weapon of Michigan Ducks)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Things go better with Type O&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Finders of this cache are to exchange bugs of all varieties--Al
Quacka scientists want to look for potentially lethal microbes
carried by all species of insects. To avoid scrutiny, the cache
will also function as a regular cache with the usual trinkets, etc.
There may be alternate routes to get there. Other Al Quacka sites
are nearby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This cache will function as a regular cache after the Al Quackas
have departed. If you drive the two track towards the cache, do not
drive on the Vasa trail itself (instead park when you reach the
trail and walk). One can also get to the cache by a two mile
hike/bike/ski from the main VASA parking at N44 45.041, W085
29.596. Other Al Quacka sites are nearby.&lt;/p&gt;

This was the second our ten finds for the day; three of the ten were Al Quacka caches. Another great cache in a great location in the woods of northern Michigan. It don't get much better than this.

 Unfortunately, Woolseys plane crashed, and he and his co-pilot
were killed.&lt;br /&gt;

I don't know what gave me the biggest kick:

- Being FTF on a multi that is 128.2 miles from your home coordinates
- Being FTF on a week old cache
- Collecting the FTF prize of a rolled up 100 bill and a few singles for good measure
- Removing the log sheet and realizing that not only have you seen this before, but you have several just like it (without the stamp) in the back of the Jeep and as a matter of fact, you designed it ;-) I can send you the original excel file if you need more just like it.
- knowing as how this cacher had me cracking up a few weeks ago, enjoying the still present ear to ear grin that I've been wearing since I found it.

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">A three stage off set cache requiring less than 400 feet of walking.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The above coordinates will take you to the site of two unique Grand Traverse area historical events. Down the hill to the south the road follows an old RR grade. As one drives the back roads in this area, you will see the remains of many old grades, they were built to haul the logs out of the woods to the mill.(Visit GC8105) When the trees were gone, the lines were abandoned and the grades were either used as roads or became overgrown. This railway was unique in that it was gravity powered, the logs were boomed to this spot on the lake, loaded on flat cars and then, controlled by a pair of courageous breakmen,the train rolled down the hill to dump in the Boardman river. Horses were then used to tow the train back up here. Over 9 million board feet of timber traveled this route.

In 1906, Arbutus Lake to the north was overflowing at the low spot just to the west and Traverse City was in a panic. Men sped into town announcing that the water from the lakes would cause the river to flood the town. The story spread that a young man, Waldo Culver, had a grudge against the town and intended to wipe it out. The sheriff hooked up his buggy and galloped out to investigate.

He found that Culver was indeed draining Spider Lake, through a ditch down into Spring Lake and with a series of dams and pipes, was washing away the hillsides. The result was he had filled Arbutus Lake to overflowing, and it was all legal. He had been hired to create a cranberry marsh and had the State permits to use the water of the lakes to do it. Imagine the amount of water needed to bring the lake level up to the level of the road. It’s fortunate that there were no cottages here back then.

Count the number of mailboxes on the south side of the road (black, white, red, green and all) and add the total to each of the following coordinates; N44 39.569  W085 30.604 and drive to that spot.

To the east is Spring Lake. The private drive ahead follows the ditch and cut Culver created. The marshy pasture on either side of the paved road is the bog land he created by using the lake water to sluice away the hills on either side of the cut. When his backers lost interest in 1908, the project was abandoned and over time the lakes have reverted to their present levels.

On the yellow plastic post along side the pavement is a phone number. Subtract the last three digits from the following coordinates; N44 40.813   W085 30.959

When you get to the lake, look to the SE. The ditch Culver dug is on private property, blocked by an earthen dam through the channel about 1/4 mile from here. 

The cache, a 1 quart camouflaged container with a log book and a selection of trinkets is just a short walk of about 400 feet.</groundspeak:long_description>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This cache brought me (Mrs. Geopirates) home!!!!   Thanks so much for the hide and the history and the adventure.....  You see the private drive that goes behind the marsh of stage 2, belongs to my family and has for a century (just after the Culver incident)!!!!  My great grandfather and his two brothers after coming to this great country from Hungry purchased many acres around Spring Lake.... they build a small cottage then made of not much more then mud and sticks (I kid you not) as a summer vacation cottage.  Full time they lived in Chicago.  Through the years the property has been divided and sold to many, however a great portion of that was still in the family and in 1974 my mother and father was able to purchase a piece of that property.  Our property is just in front of Spring Lake and along a little creek that delivers water from Spring Lake to Arbutus Lake.

Spring Lake has its name because it is a naturally spring fed lake and it is constantly running, so a flow of water is always running down that creek down to the marsh, across the road and then continues down the creek to Lake Arbutus.  From the way I understand the story (and I may be wrong) Culver was indeed attempting to start a cranberry marsh by the way explained in the cache description and drain Arbutus Lake with the help of Spider Lake and the spring feed lake....and was feared to be successful.  The town of TC feared that the flooding would lead to the Boardman river and the lead right through the heart of TC.... of course he was not successful and stopped all attempts.  

This very interesting story was published in a book called Vinegar Pie and Other Takes of the Grand Traverse Region, by Al Barnes and can be found at Horizon Books downtown.  My oldest niece did a paper on it at school over 15 years ago which sparked an immediate interest in my father (the investigator).  For years we noticed the dugout trenches and old broken down damns in the creek beside our home and always wondered why, what, where, and who, but that was the end of our curiosity until my father’s interest sparked.  After that he would walk the trenches weekly and in his time found many interesting items.  Old shovel heads, axes and hoes were among some of the items.  

In any case this story is true and I was very excited to complete this since it is part of my families property history.  We loved it and besides almost rolling the Durango (careful the road side next to the marsh is soft and not something you want to pull over to far to... thank goodness for a Hemi...LOL) we have a BLAST.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!  Sorry to be long winded.....  yikes...

Then grabbed the final stage after leaving the in-laws to head home.  Quick find after we found the best way to get into it.   I'm not sure if the hunters tree stand was present when you placed this cache but there is a tree stand now only about 15 or 20 ft from the caches.  It may be best to not look like a deer when looking for this one during the fall season.  Thanks for the cache!</groundspeak:text>

Anyhooooo..... the 3 stager was fun. We had a little discrepancy when we got to the mail boxes. I wanted to count the press boxes along with the mail boxes, dshann insisted that USPS mail boxes do not mean press boxes, thus the math calculations added up by counting..... (you figure it out )how many mail boxes plus or not press boxes to count for the figures. At any rate we found the cache. The property where the cache is located is very pretty. Worth the deputes and the calculations. TNLN SL TFTC</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Started on this puzzler last winter,, and never did get it figured for sure. Did have a guess but nothing more.

Last week I did a Whitard puzzle run and decided to give it a try and see what I could find. That is when things started going wrong.

Mistake #1 was not having a definite solution before heading out.
Mistake #2 was not verifying that I didn't have the right answer.
Mistake #3 was trying it after 8pm.
Mistake #4 was trusting my memory.
Mistake #5 was not checking the maps of the area first.
Mistake #6 was being short on common sense.

I got on site and headed to where my best guess was at and figured to just take a quick look around and see if I could get lucky enough to find it. This is where mistakes #1 and #2 come in. When I got to where the GPS pointed I did a look around and found nothing. Not real surprised, but then I seemed to remember that several logs had mentioned finding the cache on the way back out. Somewhere my mind inserted the phrase "along the trail" into those logs. So I figured that I would just go towards the creek until I found the trail and then start looking on the way back out. This is where mistakes #3, 4 and 5 come in. The GPS showed that the creek wasn't to far away so I headed out down the hill through the tree branches up to the edge of the swamp. The swamp was fairly dry so I headed on across to the other side. The trees and brush didn't start out to bad so I kept going, thinking the trail would show up really soon. Then the brush started closing in and the ground getting a bit wetter but the creek was getting closer and the best place for a trail would be along the creek so I pushed forward. Then I spotted the creek,,, and no trail. Decision time,, and time for mistake #6. I knew what I had gone through to get to this point so I could either go back or head up the creek and hope to pick up the trail. Having hopes of finding an easier way out I headed up the creek toward the road. Lets just say that it was an interesting experience, and there isn't any trail along the creek!! Got back to the truck and decided that was enough caching for one day, time to head for home.

I stared at the puzzle picture several times over the course of last week but still couldn't put things into place and get a set of solid numbers. Armed with my recon knowledge from last weeks adventure and another general guess for a location I headed back to see what I could do today. I had in mind to find the cache, get a set of coordinates and then try to solve the puzzle backwards.

I didn't correct mistakes 1 &amp; 2, but did take care of 3, 4 and 5.
#6 is kind of normal for me so I didn't worry to much about it.


I walked back out to where the GPS was pointing and was amazed at the beautiful view that I had missed last week. I started looking around but came up empty. Again no surprise. I started doing a systematic search pattern until I hit paydirt!! Only 341 feet from where I had guessed it to be, thats not to bad, kind of.  I got the log signed and took a set of coordinates to try and figure out the puzzle with. Ahhhh,,, sweet success!!

After having found Al Quacka Aviation Administration (ALQUAA) earlier today I think I now understand why I am having so much trouble with the picture on the cache page. It looks like some of the cell members may be hiding out in some of Whitards other puzzles. Check out the picture that I have been using.

Thanks for a great puzzle and caching experience,

You'll find the cache located just off the edge of a seasonal road that runs between Hobbs Hwy N. and Rennie Lake Rd.  Those traveling down Hobbs Hwy N. planning to head East on Supply road can cut just about 3 miles off of their trip if they take this shortcut.

Cache may be un-accessible in the winter time unless you plan to ski or snow shoe in.

There is a PathTag prize for the First To Find.  The rest has been stocked nicely with some Betty Boop pens, some toys, a flash light compass, some pins and a few travel bugs.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Time for just one more and on a shortcut to home to boot.  Found the container at 4:45 after wandering around some.  After logging the find and before replacing the cache, another vehicle approached and the occupants stopped to talk about the upcoming bow season opener for whitetails tomorrow.  I confessed that we were hunting “something else”, and explained caching.  One of the men had a relative who is big into caching in this area, but didn’t know his “geo-name”.  The other man had never heard of Geocaching.  We had a pleasant chat before they headed off to prep their hunting spots for the morning and we headed for home.  TN L-Sig Card.</groundspeak:text>

The cache is in a public access to Bear Lake, so use some stealth on the way in and out. We have often seen hawks, and also eagles in this place. It's a beautiful corner of the lake, and perfect for a picknick. Please make sure to rehide the cache well!

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the horror of the moment, Herb Morrison, radio reporter for
station WLS, can be forgiven for not noticing the covey of Al
Quacka ducks on that fateful night in May 1937 at Lakehurst Naval
Air Station, New Jersey. The mystery of why the Hindenburg exploded
has long lingered. Only now has Yermamma been Maudlin chosen to
reveal what really happened - that as the Hindenberg was in the
process of mooring, it was downed by
&lt;a href="http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=3f1b1dfb-0ae6-4f04-94a0-688d659b2d6a"&gt;
Al Quacka Sleeper Cell&lt;/a&gt; members using an early crude shoulder
launched duck anti-dirigible (DAD) weapon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hindenburg was a huge airship displacing over two hundred
tons and was over 800 feet long. Prior to the explosion it had
completed ten previous round trips across the Atlantic. It was
operated by the Nazi Ministry of Propaganda (a huge swastika was
painted on its tail). When the Hindenburg exploded, it was in the
process of completing its twenty-first trans-Atlantic flight and
had 36 passengers and 61 crew on board. There were 62
survivors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long forgotten are several replica mooring towers in the
Traverse City area. The cache is located near one of them.Finders
are to exchange only genuine Hindenburg artifacts (of course,
again, who is really going to know?!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache can be reached from Bunker Hill Road and probably
other access points as well. One option would be to travel west
(rightward) on the two track from the intersection at N 44 44.180,
W 085 26.197 (just off of Bunker Hill Rd). In general, stay on two
tracks and utility right of ways as bushwhacking may lead you onto
private land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Click&lt;/b&gt; on the image above to learn more about the
Hindenburg and to actually hear Mr Morrison's reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;New!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;b&gt;- listen
&lt;a href="http://www.sparkybarky.com/AlQuackaSecrets.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;
for Yermamma's advice for finding Al Quacka caches!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other Al Quacka sites are nearby. Have fun!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

I don't think it will be necessary to move the cache, but that is my opinion.  	[:D]

As we were reaching the point of catastrophe in our 24 mile trail ride we stopped to look for this one and get a much needed refuel granola bar. We barely made the hill climb, found this quickly, then tried to rest up before heading back to the bikes. She sat down on the log, and the bike shorts did their best to resist the water logged in the log, but all that really did was soak it up more. This was our last cache of the day. We had hoped to make it to the northern VASA quacka caches, especially the one we spent a lot of math time on, but at this point, we weren't sure if we could make it back, much less head further into the wild.

The Quite Area has miles of well groomed trail with numerous water access sites.  The area also features several scenic overlook platforms and a boardwalk through a typical northern Michigan wetland area.
&lt;P&gt;The cache is located less than 1,000 ft from a designated parking area (N 44° 39.18' W 085° 29.78') over fairly level ground.  Hikers continuing on to the visit the 
boardwalk or pond level swimming areas should be in good health and reasonably fit for the return trip to the ridge.  You might also consider industrial strength mosquito repellant if attempting the boardwalk, even though there were none the day we planted the 
cache.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;

Al Quacka Sleeper Cell&lt;/a&gt; members go to let down there feathers?
Yes, you got it -- here at the Safe House. Yermamma chose this to
be away from intruding eyes - in fact, her map actually shows the
cache to be in the middle of a lake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding this cache isn't for the faint of heart. It may be buggy
and boggy and in wet times generally pretty difficult to get to.
There is no need to cross private property to get to the cache -
follow the two track until the last of the no trespassing signs and
then let your GPSr guide you off though the woods (state land) to
the cache. Depending on how you go it could be a walk of up to a
half mile or so. Be careful of the vegetation. Other Al Quacka
sites are nearby. Have fun!&lt;/p&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This was an experience! Almost too much for my old bones.  Spent the weekend out with son and D-I-L (Team Typowiz) and finished Easter Sunday with this one.  Almost didn't make it home in time for dinner.  Was made a little more difficult because of snow--couldn't drive as close maybe we could have. The 200 yards or so are the challnge--it is like a series of lumps--some like half filled ballons and the other firm pillows, with water between.  Balance can be a problem.Only fell once though.  Got there to find the cache still frozen in the ground.  Couldn't sign log.  The last thrill was going out to find that two vehicles had blocked the trail, so had to deal with that.  All in all it is one you'll definitely remember.  Thanks for a great cache and many others in the area.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Wow, what a way to wind up a day of caching. The cache description ALMOST does justice to this journey! From where we parked, it was 3/10 of a mile to the cache location, the last 10th of which was pure bliss (NOT!!!!). We arrived at ground zero, found the cache container still completely frozen in a block of ice. We could uncover the corner of the container, but could not excavate it completely. I have a feeling this time of year the "walk" out to the cache location is easier than it might be in the middle of summer; the downside is the container can't be removed or opened without use of a hair dryer. Unfortunately we did not have a long enough power cord. Sincere thanks to Yermamma been Maudlin for all his hard work in placing all the caches in this area - three of the 10 we found to day were Al Quacka caches, and we enjoyed all of them. Well ... I'm not sure 'enjoyed' is the word that would apply to this one ... but we DID find it!

those "this is against my better judgement" caches.  All
alone, walking through a squishy bog covered in blueberry

to top it off, having to reach in a potentially dangerous
place for the cache...Glad things ended well.  I've 
always wanted to explore a bog - it's like walking on

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Chapter One&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Osama, Obama, Yermamma……. Becky couldn’t get it out of her mind.
It had now been several years since the shock of realization that
her husband, Loren, had become Lauren in a sex change operation and
had robbed the bank in Oconomowoc. She had finally come to terms
with this and Loren/Lauren's disappearance with boyfriend, Tony, to
Winnemuca.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now there was this sudden reappearance on the scene of
Lauren as a female candidate for United States President as a
candidate of the M.O.S.S. party. She and her running mate,
   &lt;a rel="nofollow" href=
   "http://www.geocaching.com/track/details.aspx?id=48068"&gt;Al
   Gore&lt;/a&gt;, were strong on “family values” and the “war on
   terror.” Becky, of course, knew the lie that this all was and of
   their dangerous secret connections to the &lt;a rel="nofollow"
   href="http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=3f1b1dfb-0ae6-4f04-94a0-688d659b2d6a"&gt;
Al Quacka Sleeper Cell&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Becky knew also how ruthless Al Quacka could be and how her life
would be endangered were she to reveal the truth. She tossed and
turned wondering what she should do. Oh, &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;what&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; should
she do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;To be continued.....&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

And then Becky had a BRILLIANT idea...EBAY!  The local library has computers!  Becky dashed to the library and did a search for the Little Orphan Annie decoder ring only to discover that no such decoder ring exists...(those pesky little green men and their brainwashing!)
Becky was certain a decoder ring was the answer to her problem so she began bidding on a mint condition PF Flyers decoder ring (MIP with original instructions) and conveniently available for local pick up just around the corner!  There are 14 other bidders so far with less than a minute until the auction ends!  Now Becky is a cagey EBAYer and wisely places an exhorbitant bid to ensure winning the auction.  With decoder ring in hand, Becky visits the last site Lauren &amp; Al Gore appeared and deciphered the location code...GC1DVHZ.  With her trusty GPS in hand Becky begins her trek....</groundspeak:text>

Paired with her Nancy Drew novels, Becky had become quite the detective for the tender age of 10. Although those days were long ago...she felt certain if she could just find a decoder ring she would be able to track down Algore and get her bike &amp; laptop back! With all her research on global warming and enviromentally friendly upgrades, she recalled researching that when Algore toured industrial plants and factories he always etched in the coordinates to his next appearance location in code.....all she needed was that ring!.........

&lt;br /&gt;
Located in the Pere Marquette State Forest, the Vasa Pathway
features a series of loops (3K, 5K, 10K, 25K) that offer users a
variety of challenges from easy to difficult. The Vasa Pathway is
maintained and groomed for cross country skiing by TART Trails
under an agreement with the Michigan Department of Natural
Resources and Grand Traverse County. The Vasa Pathway is used by
cross country skiers, runners, hikers, mountain bikers, walkers,
and naturalists year round. It is the home of the North American
Vasa cross country ski race and the annual Iceman Cometh mountain
bike race also uses a portion of the trail. 
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4" face="Times" color="red"&gt;It is not necessary to
jump through the sticker/pamphlet hoops to log this
cache.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got the idea for our Trekking Traverse Trails series from a
similar series in Florida. As a reward for the first 50 who wish
one and who complete the series, we have created a Path Tag on
which is the Traverse City logo. To acquire a tag, stop at the
Traverse City Visitors Center(
&lt;a href="http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=70e9c579-f72c-44c7-a0c3-b06d5830fd3b"&gt;
GC17HZ4&lt;/a&gt;), and pick up a free Trekking Traverse Trails
brochure.&lt;br /&gt;
In each cache container you will find a sticker for that cache.
Paste each of the ten stickers in the brochure, mail it in, and we
will sent you your tag.&lt;/p&gt;

You may wish to either walk the path from Brown Bridge pathway which is about a mile one way, or paddle up or down the river from Brown Bridge Pond or Sheck's Place. Just maybe there is a shorter way by a road or cross country. The cross country route may be easier or more challenging than the rating. If you choose the pathway there are hundreds of steps to help you on the hill. Enjoy!!! &lt;p

If anyone finds this litter when finding this cache and you have something to put it in to remove from the site, please note that in your entry for this cache.

I had seen the pics in the logs for the up stream cache &amp; have been looking forward to walking on this boardwalk, it's as good as I thought it would be. The cache location is beautiful.

Bridge Quiet area. Follow Brown Bridge road along the river. There
are a few parking areas along the road, most only for one vehicle.
Closest is at N44 38.813 W85 28.652. Follow the path that few use
down to the river. You will have to balance on a fallen tree to
follow the path. Some areas look very mucky, stay on the path and
you will be fine. Somebody years ago placed boards down to help get
you along without getting your feet wet. Congrats to Squidriggens

Between the trees, thick clouds, and poor bird geometry, we were seeing &gt;40 EPE readings, ouch.

Bear Lake is a village located in Manistee County, Michigan and its beginnings were similar to other small communities in Northern Michigan.  After the Homestead Act in 1862, settlers came to this area looking for cheap lands.  These pioneers had to clear their lands to farm and to build cabins to live in.  In 1867, Russell Smith, an early homesteader, platted the village of Bear Lake.  To stimulate commerce, Smith offered free land to anyone who would build a sawmill in Bear Lake.  Two brothers, George and David Hopkins built a large sawmill in the village in 1873.  The brothers, being industrious and forward thinking, went on to build a gristmill, a store, a  brickyard and a railroad.  The railroad ran from Kaleva to the Lake Michigan shore at Pierport.  Lumbering was in full swing and the population of Bear Lake was around 1000 people.  The village prospered until 1903 when all the valuable timber had been cut.  The railroad left and people moved on to find jobs elsewhere.  

Today, fruit orchards dot the landscape and the area is a tourist destination.  All water sports are available on the lake; in the winter, snowmobiling, cross country skiing, ice fishing are enjoyed by enthusiasts.  Hiking and camping are available in the nearby Manistee National Forest having the North County Trail, a wonderful trail system.  Another nearby place of interest is the Northern Michigan Dragway on Potter Rd.  

Bear Lake has so much to offer visitors especially those looking for  peace and serenity in beautiful surroundings.</groundspeak:long_description>

After finding several along the river to point of inability of going no further by land, I wanted to see what was on the other side knowing there was a cache just across the river. The Terrain on the other side is much different. The cache I went for was more challenging on the other side. I thought it would be good to find yet another in this specific area so I planted the "wishbone cache" in the vicinity. No trail to this but the walk is pleasant.

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To locate this cache the finder will have to solve for the
intersection of the lines formed by (1) the Al Quacka Safehouse (N
44 45.202, W 085 25.780) and Al Quacka and the Titanic (N 44
42.210, W 085 24.635) and (2) Final Approach (N 44 43.797, W 085
21.738) and Touchdown (N 44 44.413, W 085 33.918).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any two points will define a straight line whose slope, m, can
be determined by this calculation:
(y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)/(x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) = m. In
this case y = latitude and x = longitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The equation for a straight line can be determined by this
formula: y - b = m(x - a) where a and b are the known respective
x,y coordinates for one of the points on the line. The solution for
the line derived from this equation appears in the form y = mx + b
where b is the y intercept (where the line crosses the y axis).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the equations for the two lines are determined, then one
solves for where these equations have the same solution to define
where the lines intersect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The coordinates at the top of this page are not for the cache
itself but are for a convenient access point. Other approaches
might get you onto private land&lt;/b&gt; This cache was fun to set up
and hopefully will be fun to solve. Doubtless, the intersection of
these lines can be very closely approximated using mapping software
that many of us have with our GPS receivers (but that is too
easy!). Feel free to email &lt;a href=
"mailto:whitard@yahoo.com"&gt;Whitard&lt;/a&gt; if you need some help in
solving this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have fun!&lt;/p&gt;

She went math-crazy, and solved a fistful of them - many of which we've still not gotten out to find. My Dad (EdMar2), NumberOneWife and I were looking to kill time on a beautiful sunny Easter Sunday, so we headed out to find a few. This was our fourth find of the day, and the second of our three Al Quacka finds on the day. Despite being largely ignored by other cachers for quite awhile now, the cache is still in great condition just waiting to be found. Took nothing, left a sig card. Thanks for the hide!

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I hate to say that i like math, because i don't. I hated math all through elementary school, junior high, high school and college. However, i was always good at it. (Trivia: one of my part time jobs while attending GLMA was as an algebra tutor at NMC. That didn't last long, because the hours and the pay were not so great.) Now that i no longer have to do school math, and can instead play with math problems cleverly disguised as geocaches, i don't dislike it so much. But i refuse to say i like it [;)]

There was quite a bit of dirt road involved in getting this cache. I got as far as i could in the car, and found myself a scant tenth of a mile (or so) from the hide. When i got to GZ, i saw a bunch of cut trees, and i was worried for a while that the cache might have been disturbed. But i eventually found it, safe and sound and well hidden. I left a duck, in keeping with the theme. Thanks for the cache!!</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Worked out the calculations last winter and put them away for a future trip up north. Figured whats the rush, AlQuacka will be around forever, so no need to hurry. I couldn't have been more wrong.

It looks like the whereabouts of ALQUAA have been compromised and the agents of the Department of Homeland Security have been trying to zero in on the exact location.  Working under cover as a logging company they have been systematically removing acres of trees in an attempt to locate Yermamma been Maudlin and the Aviation Administration. The destruction is wide spread and at first look one would think that all has been lost. Hundreds of trees have been cut down in the effort, many hauled off and stacked in large piles out of the way, others still laying on the ground waiting to be removed. Tree tops and branches are everywhere covering the ground. "Oh, the humanity !!"

I showed up on site about 5 pm and Homeland Security wasn't around [Must be due to budget cuts] allowing me to check the area to see if anything remained. I did some searching through the waste of a once fine woods distraught with despair at the carnage. After a time I began thinking that Homeland Security may have found what they were after and that all was lost, but before giving up I checked out one more area and made the find.  The Aviation Administration complex was exposed but is still intact!!!

I set about the task of logging in, then getting things better concealed when I spotted a few of the fly boys,,, err,, ducks, hiding nearby. [see photo] They told of many Sleeper Cell members having to leave and go under deep cover while they remained to keep watch on the Aviation Administration complex. They have had some close calls and air travel has been reduced, but so far all is safe. Only time will tell what is to become of them.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">While hiking through out Northern Michigan woodlands I've noticed  several scorthed old timber and stumps. I recall my father telling me about massive forest fires through out Michigan in the late 1800's. 

 Michigan was dealt grievous blows as fires swept across the state, wiping out or endangering entire cities, towns, and villages including Holland, Manistee, Grand Rapids, South Haven, and Port Huron doing millions of dollars worth of property damage and killing hundreds.

It is probably impossible for us to fathom what the threat of fire was like in those days.

During the autumn of 1871, a forest fire swept across Michigan laying claim to life, property, and natural resources, primarily in Sanilac, Huron, and Tuscola counties. “A sky of flame, of smoke, a Heavenful”, the earth a mass of burning coals, the mighty trees, all works of man between and living things trembling as a child before a demon in the gale, is how the Michigan fire of 1871 was described in history records.

As quoted by James Langworth “the inferno surrounded me on all sides but one, to escape, I plunged into the woods leaping wildly over burning piles of leaves. It seemed as though the entire state of Michigan was on fire.

Small fires that broke out gradually ran together drawing dry air from inland rather than moist air from over the lakes. Wind carried chips and fragments, starting new fires. Big brush piles left by logging practices of the time added to the ferocity of the fires. “The tree crowns left on the ground by logging operations created an enormous fuel for the fires,” said Burton Barnes of the University of Michigan’s School of Natural Resources and Environment. “The pine needles and stems accumulated on the ground contained heavy amounts of resin and, combined with leaves and other organic matter, burned very hot. These were not like the fires we see today, that burn hottest in the air. These fires burned hottest on the ground.”

On Sunday, Oct. 8, 1871, the fire started blowing, burning, killing, and devouring everything in its path. In some communities, people went to bed at night, only to be aroused at midnight by the fearful cry of “Fire!” They watched their homes, farms; livestock and belongings vanish into smoke and ashes. Some were able to save themselves. “Others, choked with flame and smoke, left only their charred bones to tell their friends where and how they died,” said one report. Thousands of acres of valuable pine were gone in a matter of hours.

The firestorm forced people into Lake Waters. Some took refuge in boats, covering themselves with wet blankets. In Huron County, families tried to outrace the fire. One family climbed into a wagon, covered themselves with wet blankets, and headed for a millrace a half-mile away, arriving just before the wagon caught fire. The family jumped into the race, covering themselves with more wet blankets. In just a half-hour, villages were in ruins. At White Rock people plunged into the lake, but the lake was so rough that women and children were thrown back onto the beach. They risked death by drowning in order be saved from death by fire. Some dug holes in the ground or a bank and managed to survive by crawling into the shelter. Losses included crops, houses, businesses, livestock, grain, hay, bridges, and crossings in swamps.

The great Michigan fires of 1871 received little publicity because the great Chicago fire and the Peshtigo, WI fires occurring at the same time, overshadowed them. Some claim that lightning started the fires, while others say meteor showers were to blame. Author Mel Waskin, who wrote Mrs. O’Leary’s Comet, stated that a comet collided with the earth, and that Chicago, Wisconsin and Michigan were all showered with fiery particles at exactly the same time.

Yet, with all its magnitude and intensity, the fire of 1871 did not consume all the timber, but in most places only deadened the green timber and prepared the way for a more terrible calamity 10 years later. The population was denser on Sept. 5, 1881, when a firestorm traveled across the state again, causing a repeat calamity of the 1871 fires, causing over 300 people dead and hundreds injured. To save themselves, some residents jumped into wells, remaining there for up to five hours before crawling out. Others never made it out.

After the fire of 1881, more than 14,000 people were made dependent on public aid, and 1,480 barns, 1,521 dwellings, and 51 schools were destroyed. On May 21, 1881, Clara Barton established the American Red Cross. Just 4 months later on Sept 4, 1881, the Red Cross undertook its first disaster relief effort aiding victims of the Michigan forest fires.</groundspeak:long_description>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Spent this Veterans day Wed afternoon caching. Perfect afternoon for being in the woods in November with the warm &amp; sunny temps. The bunker that folks have wondered about in the area of this cache is much more interesting now that I took some time to explore it. It appears to be some kind of (jail) ??? there are iron bars that at one time encased the entire bunker with reinforcements over the crude window opening. The iron has been bent over &amp; back away from the bunker but still incased under ground on one side. Also we noticed some kind of circular something or other built of rocks next to it. Remins of cement slab surrounds the area of the bunker. I'm very curious about the origin of this strange bunker thing &amp; hope to learn about it through research. Anyhooo..... back to the cache..... we found it, logged it and took the beautiful white birch branch leaning against it to use as a walking stick on the way to GC1J20y. Good thing cause it came in handy while crossing the stream over mossy covered downed trees to get to the other side of the soggy stream to find that cache. TFTC, T-N L-N</groundspeak:text>

We saw two cacher names who've logged in the paper log here, but not online. Perhaps we'll try to contact them. The amphibians were calling, so their presence indicates quality water, eh? Also observed some fish hitting water beetles on the surface. Then seeing blue gill beds we wish we'd brought tackle, heheheh. We noticed the compressor shed by the gas well wide open, called the 800 number and were informed this is normal. Vandals could have a field day, but hey, it's not our problem now. They did thank me for taking the care to call. Thanks for the fun out in the back woods and TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="black"&gt;GEOLOGY OF CHAIN O&amp;#8217; LAKES&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="black"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="green"&gt;The Chain O&amp;#8217;
Lakes system was formed as part of the glacial scour process that
the formed the Great Lakes. The surface geology of the Chain
O&amp;#8217; Lakes, including Elk Lake and its surrounding area, was
formed 10,000 to 12,000 years ago by glacial activity, which was
dominated by medium-textured glacial till, composed of non-sorted
glacial debris, loam and silt loam texture with variable amounts of
cobbles and boulders. The Bedrock consists of Berea Sandstone,
Bedford Shale and Ellsworth Shale. Numerous advances and retreats
by the glaciers resulted in the locally complex pattern of erosion
and deposition. The drainage channels scoured by the glaciers
resulted in depressions oriented linearly from the northwest to the
southeast. Along the lakes, the geological composition is primarily
Lacustrine sand and gravel. This type of sand and gravel typically
occur as former beaches and near offshore deposits of the glacial
Great Lakes.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

"black"&gt;CHAIN O&amp;#8217; LAKES
WATERSHED&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="black"&gt;&lt;font color="green"&gt;&lt;font color=
"black"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="green"&gt;The Chain O&amp;#8217; Lakes Watershed
provides approximately 60% of the input of surface water input to
the Grand Traverse Bay. As such, &amp;#8220;Watershed Management&amp;#8221;
of this unique resource is vital. Watershed Management is an
iterative process of integrated decision-making regarding uses and
modifications of lands and waters within a watershed. This process
provides a chance for stakeholders to balance diverse goals and
uses for environmental resources, and to consider how their
cumulative actions may affect long-term sustainability of these
resources. The Guiding Principles of the process are Partnerships,
Geographic Focus, &amp;amp; Sound Management (strong science &amp;amp;
data).&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="black"&gt;&lt;font color="green"&gt;&lt;font color=
"black"&gt;&lt;font color="green"&gt;As a form of ecosystem management,
watershed management encompasses the entire watershed system, from
uplands and headwaters, to floodplain wetlands and river channels.
It focuses on the processing of energy and materials (water,
sediments, nutrients, and toxics) downslope through this system. Of
principle concern is management of the basin's water budget, that
is the routing of precipitation through the pathways of
evaporation, infiltration, and overland flow. This routing of
groundwater and overland flow defines the delivery patterns to
particular streams, lakes, and wetlands; and largely shapes the
nature of these aquatic
systems.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

After that our chores for the weekend were complete. Our plans were to slowly head home and grab some caches along the way. This was our 5th find on our way home. Tyler(7) and I had to search a bit for this one, but we persevered, after moving a lot of logs, and uncovered the hide.  We then signed the log and returned it to its hiding spot.

After that our chores for the weekend were complete. Our plans were to slowly head home and grab some caches along the way. This was our 4th find on our way home. Tyler(7) and I took the scenic route a bit as the gps was bouncing around, but we eventually circled in close enough to make the find.  We then signed the log and returned it to its hiding spot. Thanks for being a part of a great caching day, during a wonderful father-son weekend.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">After caching for quite some time, I've decided to start putting out a few caches of my own.  Yep, no more sitting on the sidelines, the only question is where in the state I'd like to put them out.  Well, the area above Traverse City is about as pretty and remote as it gets, and that's what I like.  This cache was placed on private property behind a mom and pop convenience store with the permission of the owners who are my friends.  It should be exceptionally easy to find, even if you have never been caching before, but is disguised so that the casual observer would take no notice of it.  Trust me, no hints are necessary.  Even though this cache isn't placed in the pristine remote areas I like to visit, it's my start at hopefully will be quite a few in the area.
By the way, there is plenty of cover so you shouldn't have to worry about muggle eyeballs.</groundspeak:long_description>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Greetings,

This geocache was brought to my attention as being in need of an owner maintenance visit, because the cache has been disabled for an extended period of time. The cache owner needs to check on this cache ASAP and either replace it or archive it, after picking up any geo-litter. See the maintenance section of the Geocache Listing Guidelines

I've bookmarked this cache, and I will check back in two weeks or so to be sure that the maintenance has been done or at least a note posted here indicating your intentions.When the maintenance is completed, the owner can re-enable the listing by clicking on the link below the cache name. If no note is posed I may be forced to archive the cache.

Thank you,

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">This is one of the fourteen caches that comprise the Shore to Shore
Geochallenge
</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">On Saturday nights in the early days of the last century, families
in rural Grand Traverse county would load up the buggy or the Model
T and head "out ta Scheck's Place" along the Boardman River. Known
locally as a "model of a modern livestock farm", the barn boasted a
cork block floor. From the time the hay was used up in the spring
until the barn was refilled in the fall, community dances were held
there. They were the highlight of the week in those days before
computers. The Schecks lost their farm in the depression and today
the only reminders of those happy days are the remnants of the
concrete foundations in the State Forest campground and the fading
reminisces of the old timers. The cache site overlooks the Boardman
River less than a quarter mile outside Sheck's Place camp on the
Hopkins Creek spur of the Shore to Shore trail. 
&lt;p&gt;The Michigan Shore-To-Shore Trail begins at Lake Michigan in
Empire and ends more than 200 miles east at Lake Huron near
Oscoda.The trail was created and is maintained by the Michigan
Trail Riders Association in cooperation with the DNR. Closed to

possible and uses roadside shoulders where necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find and copy the number codes contained in all of the
containers in this 14 cache series. They will allow you to find and
unlock the Hopkins Creek cache and complete the Geochallenge.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Commemorative high quality S2S T shirts have been created and will
be presented to ten members of the first teams to complete the
challenge. To be eligible, the members receiving shirts must
&lt;b&gt;all&lt;/b&gt; have participated in the quest and must &lt;b&gt;all&lt;/b&gt; be
present and listed when logging finds. After the complimentary T
shirts have been awarded, shirts will be available for purchase by
additional challenge finishers for their cost plus shipping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is a plastic nut jar just down hill from the trail.
Depending upon where you park and the route you take it can vary
from a short stroll to a pretty good hike. As with all caches,
please take the time to hide it at least as well as you found
it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fourteen caches in the S2S Geo-challenge are;&lt;br&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Found this one after my third attempt.  First attempt, I realized I was on the wrong side of the river, and didn't have time to go searching since I needed to ride my horse and had friends waiting for me.  I decided I would ride out to find this after my ride with my friends.  That was my second attempt, when I realized my there was no way I was going risk riding my horse 150 feet down that slope, and I didn't want to leave him unattended tied to a tree while I searched.  So, my third attempt was the next day while I walked to dog.

I'm really glad I didn't try to find this last year while I was trying for the trophy ride on the MTRA S2S.  I would have been way too sore and exhausted to brave that slope.
I liked the camo, though.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Wow! I love Sheck's place.  I found a quick parking space (the campground was almost empty) and hiked down the short trail, then bushwhacked it to the river, only to find out the cache was on the other side. I was tempted to wade across, but though better to cut my losses for not reading the description well enough. Once I got to the other side, I was rewarded with a great, but somewhat steep hike.  I walked the horse trail, because I missed the hiking trail.  My navigation wasn't that great on this one, but it sure is a nice place.  I'll be back here.   #10 for the day in the S2S series. Time-consuming miss-steps have assured that I won't make the whole series in one day. (Awww [:(] )  The good news is that I get to do more of these places another day.  Thanks for the cache.

So, what was happening fifty years ago?

50’s Rock &amp; Roll, drive-in movies &amp; roller skates.
Ike was president. Hawaii became our 50th state.
Elvis was shaking his hips, Sinatra was crooning.
Leave it to Beaver &amp; Bonanza was on TV.
Gasoline was 25 cents and a loaf of bread was 20 cents.
The best thing to come out of the fifties ? 
Well, US. (just kidding !!!)  So, maybe it didn’t make the newspapers, but it is the reason we put out the geocache.

So, now that I got you to remembering the “Good Old Days”, just keep in mind that there was no internet, no satellites and no geocaching.  So all you fifty-genarians count your blessings, get out there and do some caching.

Just slip out the back, Jack
Make a new plan, Stan
Don’t need to be coy, Roy
Just get yourself “Nifty at Fifty”.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="green"&gt;GPS, or Global Positioning System, was
developed by the US Department of Defense. This satellite
navigation system was intended for military use and therefore the
signals were scrambled, limiting accuracy for civilian use to about
100 meters.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;img src="http://www.geocaching.com/images/icons/icon_smile.gif"
border="0"&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="red"&gt;On May 1, 2000, the President
announced that this scrambling, known as Selective Availability
(SA), would be turned off. Civilians were then able to enjoy
accuracy on the order of 10 meters. Geocaching was born the very
next day.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="black"&gt;On April 1, 2004, the first recorded death
of a Geocacher was reported right here in Grand Traverse County.
Apparently, an unnamed Geocacher went out into the thick Michigan
woods and forgot to bring spare batteries for his GPS, got lost and
wondered aimlessly until he died of exposure and starvation. His
body was found several months later. Initially, he was buried next
to a golf course, as you can see by the picture of his tombstone

&lt;p&gt;After ninety-one years Yermamma been Maudlin has chosen to tell
what really happened. &lt;a rel="nofollow"

Al Quacka&lt;/a&gt; agents, principally Yergrandpa been Maudlin, were
responsible for sinking the Titanic. Being ducks, naturally they
all survived and didn't require rescue by the Carpathia and thus
their presence was not previously noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finders of this cache are to exchange only genuine Titanic
artifacts (of course, who is going to know!?). Unlike for Mr.
Ballard and his search this should be an easy find. There are
probably a number of ways to approach the cache - one place to park
would be at N 44 42.001, W 085 24.454. Other Al Quacka sites are
nearby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Click&lt;/b&gt; on the image above to learn more about the Titanic.
If you have a deep sea submersible, you can hunt for artifacts at
about N 41 46, W 050 14. Have fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Muncie Lakes Pathway is in the Pere Marquete State Forest like Sand
Lakes but in many ways is it's opposite. It is crisscrossed by two
tracks which see heavy use by snowmobiles in the winter. On the
other hand, also unlike Sand Lakes, the trails are groomed for
cross country skiing by the DNR. For that reason, next to the Vasa,
it is the most popular CC Ski trail in the area. 
&lt;p&gt;The Pathway consists of over 10 miles of well marked trails, the
longest is a 9 mile loop. There are shorter loops of 7, 3, and 1
1/2 miles. The trail goes to Muncie Lakes, a series of small lakes
and marshes, about 2 miles. The long loop goes north to Dollar
Lake, and passes very close to Island Lake then swings south and
comes back along the Boardman River.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4" face="Times" color="red"&gt;It is not necessary to
jump through the sticker/pamphlet hoops to log this
cache.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got the idea for our Trekking Traverse Trails series from a
similar series in Florida. As a reward for the first 50 who wish
one and who complete the series, we have created a Path Tag on
which is the Traverse City logo. To acquire a tag, stop at the
Traverse City Visitors Center(
&lt;a href="http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=70e9c579-f72c-44c7-a0c3-b06d5830fd3b"&gt;
GC17HZ4&lt;/a&gt;), and pick up a free Trekking Traverse Trails
brochure.&lt;br /&gt;
In each cache container you will find a sticker for that cache.
Paste each of the ten stickers in the brochure, mail it in, and we
will sent you your tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">This is our tribute to Florida Geocaching. A magnetic Key Holder
deep in the woods. It's not camouflaged but it is under a piece of
metal. Bring your own pencil. 
&lt;p&gt;Terrain will be lower with the right 2 track, difficulty will be
lower with experience.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Last winter when we were in Florida, we discovered that the Florida
cachers are enamoured with what we consider to be a wonderful,
unique, cache container. With great ingenuity, they have converted
Magnetic Key Holders into micros. How great is that? 
&lt;p&gt;We found them everywhere, on guard rails, in newspaper boxes, on
the back of signs, on parking lot light poles, under junction
boxes, on railroad equipment, anything that was metal and was over
500 feet away from another one was a spot for a magnetic cache. How
much fun is that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went right out and bought our own to share with our fellow
northern Michigan cachers. We discussed placing it in town but
decided that for folks to get the true exciting impact, we should
emulate another of our favorite caches, the micro in the woods. We
spent the spring and early summer walking through the woods
fruitlessly searching for a suitable piece of metal to which we
could attach our magnet. How frustrating was that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, success! Today we spotted a piece of rusty metal junk,
perhaps discarded some time ago by a hunter or a geocacher. It was
just lying on the ground under a tree. How lucky is that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of going to the trouble of carrying it out of the woods,
we lifted it up, slapped our magnet on it, covered it with debris,
grabbed the coordinates and published it as a cache. How clever is
that?&lt;/p&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I found this cache on the second day of a five day caching trip. Earlier today my Pocket PC crapped out and I lost all of my paperless cache data including my logs. This morning started out less than perfect. My truck wouldn't start so Team CoyChev gave me a jump and offered to follow me in to Big Rapids to get the battery checked out. He's such a nice guy and Donna is pretty nice too.  Well I was close by so I figured to try this micro in the woods since I had lost all of my paperless cache info which means no hints.  I searched for several minutes before I spotted this clever hide.  At the time I couldn't tell who hid it until now as I log it.  I suspected it was basswoodbend's handy work and I was right.

After being worried that “something was in the water over there on the Boardman” [;)] we can now rest assured that all is well, and that this magnetic micro in the woods is “one of ours”.

Township Cemetery. As with all Cemetery or Spirit caches, please
respect the gravesites of the departed and any visitors other than
yourselves who might be present. To solve this puzzle, your task is
to park near the posted coordinates and climb the steps of the
mound. Search until you find a pair of matching benches that invite
you to sit a spell. After a long life together, Glen and Marjorie
Hoopfer both passed away in 2006. While sitting, calculate and
consider the number of days that Marjorie lived without her
husband. 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Subtract that number from the North coordinates 44 52.900 and add
it to the West coordinates 85 21.462. We have noticed that due to
the nature of Cemetery or Spirit caches, they are usually of the
Log Only variety. We have decided to follow that practice and so
this is definitely a Log Only cache. If the Log is full or missing,
please notify us and we will replace the Log.&lt;/p&gt;

Got to this one and did that I needed to do at the grave stones and made my way to the final.  Found it and did not find any log entry so I thought I was the first to find, I even did the dance and sign the log as being the first.  I do not know how I missed Squidriggens log entry.  Does not matter to me I will gladdy take a 2nd TF.  Found it at 12:45pm for our 3rd find of the day.  Thanks for the cache!.

Depending on what trail you take, you can get a car within ~400' of the cache.  Cache is filled with plenty of swag and a great spot to drop off TB's.  As always have fun in nature!

We traveled down the 2 track to see if we could find a bridge. Guess what we found a bridge. The bridge went over were 2 creeks come together. We followed a trail then bushwhacked but could only get within 2 tenths of a mile of the cache. Decided to go back to where I was closed to the cache and low and behold if it had been a snake it would have bitten me when I was there before. No it is not on the other side of the creek.

&lt;br /&gt;
This site is part of the North Country National Scenic Trail that
when finished will stretch more than 4,000 miles from New York to
North Dakota. There are 575 miles of trail in Michigan which are
certified—more than in any other state. Approximately 45 miles of
this National Trail occurs in the Pere Marquette State Forest in
Grand Traverse and Wexford Counties. 
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4" face="Times" color="red"&gt;It is not necessary to
jump through the sticker/pamphlet hoops to log this
cache.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got the idea for our Trekking Traverse Trails series from a
similar series in Florida. As a reward for the first 50 who wish
one and who complete the series, we have created a Path Tag on
which is the Traverse City logo. To acquire a tag, stop at the
Traverse City Visitor's Center(
&lt;a href="http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=70e9c579-f72c-44c7-a0c3-b06d5830fd3b"&gt;
GC17HZ4&lt;/a&gt;), and pick up a free Trekking Traverse Trails
brochure.&lt;br /&gt;
In each cache container you will find a sticker for that cache.
Paste each of the ten stickers in the brochure, mail it in, and we
will sent you your tag.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">A park and grab in the woods at an unusual spot. The cache is a
clear 1 pint Lock-n-Lock.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">It would appear that S. W. Northrop was pretty much of a failure.
He was unsuccessful as a farmer, unsuccessful as a father, and
unsuccessful as a husband. Shortly after the end of the Civil War,
he was attempting to eke out a living on a small farm in upper New
York State with his wife Charlotte and their two children. Soon
after their young daughter Emma died, perhaps of illness, the cause
is unrecorded, he became aware that many of his neighbors were
taking advantage of cheap land "Out West" in Michigan. In the early
1880’s lumber companies were advertising that they were selling
excellent farm land in northern Michigan at extremely favorable
prices. SW decided that to attempt a fresh start in a new
environment was just what he and his family needed. 
&lt;p&gt;His wife Charlotte however would have none of it. It is likely
that she could foresee what her life would be like in "the
wilderness" and wanted to stay in "civilized" New York near her own
parents. He apparently believed that if all the rest of her little
family was in Michigan, she would have no alternative but to
follow. He therefor took the unusual step of digging up his
daughter's coffin, loading it in a wagon with the rest of his
possessions and accompanied by his teen age son, came to establish
a farm in Section 19 of Union township. One can imagine what her
reaction must have been when he did that. Not surprisingly, despite
the fact that he sent numerous letters back to Charlotte entreating
her to come west to live with him, his pleas were futile. We have
not discovered what became of Charlotte but apparently she never
received a divorce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He and his son cleared the land of the pine stumps and brush and
with the help of neighbors built a cabin and barn. The absence of
large old pine stumps in this area show that these were once fields
and pastures but the absence of existing farms show that the soil
is poor. Much of this area would provide a crop or two after the
pines were removed but then the nutrients were gone. It has taken
over 100 years for the forest to recover to the state you see it
today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One winter, while working for a lumbering company to earn cash
to help pay the bills, his son plunged through the ice of one of
the lakes north of here and his body was never found. S. W.
Northrop had lost his wife, lost his children and was saddled with
a farm which could not provide him with a living. Faced with life
alone in this area, SW left. It is reported that he went back to
New York, perhaps to attempt a reconciliation with Charlotte, but
our research has not proven that he did and if he did, just exactly
where he went. His farm however was abandoned and became overgrown.
The buildings deteriorated, gradually collapsing. A short stroll to
the north will take you to some rocky rubble, all that remains of
the farm buildings. Emma’s grave became overgrown and was
forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1920’s, a hunter from the area stumbled across it and,
along with some neighboring farmers, began to care for it. When the
Depression struck and most of the land in the area reverted to the
State for non payment of taxes, the grave site became part of the
state forest and is listed as a historical feature in forest
inventory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the stone was vandalized a few years ago and was removed by
the area forester in charge for repair, it was replaced with the
current monument by some anonymous locals. The site is mowed at
least twice through the summer and as the trinkets deteriorate they
are removed. Today it is visited mostly by trail riders in the
summer and snowmobiles in the winter. It is not clear when the
practice of leaving trinkets at the site began but as you can see,
today it looks like an open air geocache.&lt;/p&gt;

It wasn’t on our list of caches but we saw it coming up on the GPSr on the way back to Fife Lake and we decided to stop. It’s a good thing we did. This is a great little spot and Tasha fell in love very quickly. We spent a while looking for the cache. We read the logs to see if we could find a something to help. Hosta Hillbillys posted new coordinates in their log so we tried them but they we way off. Thinking they might have a typo in their entry we changed one of their digits and found the cache relatively quickly after that.  The coordinates we found the cache at are…

We didn’t take anything or leave anything. Thanks for the cache Lane973 and thanks for bringing us to this spot.

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">A challenging test of navigation in the Sand Lakes Quiet Area</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Sand Lakes Quiet Area is a beautiful natural area just southeast of Traverse City.  It provides qreat hiking and biking in the warmer months and great skiing and snowshoeing in the winter. There are several kettle lakes left there by ancient glaciation.&lt;p&gt;Triangulation is the principle upon which GPS receivers function to provide location.  Finder of this cache will have to do additional triangulation.  Provided below are three sets of coordinates in Lakes 2, 4, and 5 respectively (not necessarily in the middle of the lakes).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

 &lt;Table border width=70% bgcolor=ffffcc align=center&gt;&lt;TR align=center&gt;&lt;TD&gt; Lake 2&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;   N 44 42.746, W 085 21.331&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR align=center&gt;&lt;td&gt; Lake 4&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;td&gt;   N 44 42.893, W 085 20.891&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR align=center&gt;&lt;TD&gt; Lake 5&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;   N 44 42.548, W 085 20.931&lt;/td.&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To find the location of the actual cache the finder will have to further triangulate from these locations.  The cache is equidistant from each of the given coordinates which are at the angles of the triangle pictured above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finding the cache could be challenging and will likely require some preparation using map and measurement. &lt;B&gt; The coordinates given at the top of this page are for the parking area, not the cache itself.&lt;/B&gt; Finding the cache will require a one to two mile walk one way (there may be closer areas to park).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;p&gt;This could take awhile to perform so allow some time. Good luck with this geometry challenge!&lt;/P&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This cache is the newest item on my top ten list, and will likely remain a permanent fixture there. It is also the most gratifying find i have made since perhaps GCJNHZ or GCJNEX.

There are many things that make this cache awesome.

First, this is a math problem that i was not sure that i remembered how to do. The algebra part was easy, but i was basing the algebra on an assumption that i had made about geometry. Somewhere in my mind, i thought i remembered some properties of triangles, but i was not certain that i was correct. The desk in the engine control room on my ship was littered with little scribbled-on pieces of paper as i took the 3 provided sets of coordinates, inflicted some math on them, and came up with all sorts of numbers that finally led me to one set of coordinates. Google helped me "confirm" that i had done it correctly.

Finding the Sand Lakes Quiet Area and getting to a good parking spot were also factors. I saw the brown sign to the Quiet Area on my way into town on M-72. When i came back this way, i steered toward the suggested parking, but was intrigued by the advice that "there may be closer areas to park". I can't tell you how many times i've ignored suggested parking coordinates in favor of "closer" parking coordinates that end up entailing a hellacious (or impossible) bushwhack. But i found a closer parking area, looked at the trail map, and decided that i could get where i needed to go if i started at this trailhead. From my parking area, the round trip was about three miles.

The three mile hike is another aspect that makes this cache so awesomely memorable. The Sand Lakes Quiet Area has nicely-kept trails with plenty of reference points along the way at trail intersections. (For example, you are at point 3. Point 4 is .5 miles this direction, and is a moderate walk. Point 6 is .3 miles this way and is challenging terrain.) The first two segments of trail were rated as easy terrain, and the third segment was challenging. And then it was purely off-trail walking, unless i missed something [;)] 

Once i finally got to GZ, i looked in 3 [encrypted clue]s until i found the right one. There, i saw Whitard's note from when he checked on it last month, and the log from the last finder, back in SEPTEMBER 2006!! Wow. If i'd had an unactivated geocoin with me, it would have gone right in the box. I have bought some coins just to put into ubercaches like this. Unfortunately, those are all at home [:(] so i left a small flashlight and some batteries.

So, i challenged my brain with a good math puzzle, did a long hike through a really quiet and pretty area (complete with glacial kettle lakes), and found a cache that hasn't been found in a year and a half. I'm very proud of myself and i'll wear this find as a badge of honor. This is truly the antithesis to the park-and-grab micros that are so popular in my area. 

Oh. I forgot to mention. It was raining the whole time [:D]

Thanks for the experience, Whitard!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Along a centuries-old American Indian trail between Lake Mitchell
in Cadillac and West Grand Traverse Bay in Traverse City are 33
simple, numbered, white, concrete markers that identify the route
traveled through forested hills and open meadows by &lt;b&gt;ancient
tribes&lt;/b&gt; and later by the Ottawa, Chippewa and Potawatomi
Indians.

&lt;p&gt;The coordinates above will take you to the vicinity of marker
#16. The placement of the markers started in the 1940s and final
completion in 1987.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Artifacts, burial mounds, and fire pits have been found along
the vanishing trail. Most of the markers are adjacent to current
roadways, others are deep in the woods, (like this one!!!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See the old cache &lt;b&gt;#GCGB1D&lt;/b&gt; for a list of all the markers!
This cache is an ammo box loaded with trading items. It also has an
unactivated Geocoin for the First To Find Prize. The first three
finders will have their names listed here for the next 100 years.
Trade even or better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The roads in this area are bad. Have FUN and post some pictures.
I like to see how the area changes with the seasons.&lt;/p&gt;

The terrain has allot of hills in it.  Would be passable on a mountain bike.  The cache is off the trail a hundred feet of so.  The cache is wrapped in a plastic sack.  It has two fifty dollar bills in it, a tigers baseball card from the late eighty's and some sort of hand held electronic devise.  The Cache should not be very difficult to find.  One more thing, I forgot to put a pad of paper and pen in the cache, if someone could do that for me, it would be great.  Be sure to check out the great overlooks of the Manistee river,

&lt;br /&gt;
The Sand Lakes are located in the Pere Marquette State Forest.
Motorized vehicles are prohibited, making this area a great place
to watch wildlife, hike, bike, or cross country ski. It has five
marl lakes surrounded by rolling hills of oak-pine forest. The
sediments at the bottom of marl lakes contain a lot of calcium
carbonate deposited by glaciers. Several of the lakes are more than
40 feet deep and managed for trout. Lake #1 has rainbow trout, Lake
#2 has brook trout. An extensive 11 mile trail system allows
visitors to explore the lakes and surrounding area on foot, skis,
or bike. 
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4" face="Times" color="red"&gt;It is not necessary to
jump through the sticker/pamphlet hoops to log this
cache.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got the idea for our Trekking Traverse Trails series from a
similar series in Florida. As a reward for the first 50 who wish
one and who complete the series, we have created a Path Tag on
which is the Traverse City logo. To acquire a tag, stop at the
Traverse City Visitors Center(
&lt;a href="http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=70e9c579-f72c-44c7-a0c3-b06d5830fd3b"&gt;
GC17HZ4&lt;/a&gt;), and pick up a free Trekking Traverse Trails
brochure.&lt;br /&gt;
In each cache container you will find a sticker for that cache.
Paste each of the ten stickers in the brochure, mail it in, and we
will sent you your tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;

We had one 'good' day to be out in the woods; tomorrow morning the woods will be full of guys with guns, and you'd have to have a death wish to be caching out here. We found the container easily; AMAZING how similar it was to the TTT TART Trail cache we found two hours earlier! :) Thanks for the hide!

Kaleva is a village in Manistee Co. Michigan with an interesting history.  In the 1880s, lumbering was the main commerce at that time and the impetus for the building of railroads. Two railroads were built and crossed in the present day village.  By 1900 the timber had been decimated and a way to  bring newcomers to the area was devised.  The Michigan Land Society found a Finnish land agent, Jacob Saari from Brooklyn, New York to sell land in this part of Manistee County to Finnish families who were looking for cheap farmlands.  Among the pioneers who arrived in Kaleva were the families of John Haksluto, Jacob Lemponen, Antti Myllyla and John Palomaki.  Most were farmers who had to clear their lands for homes and for fields for their crops.  The settlers named the town Kaleva from the Finnish epic poem Kalevala and the original street names also came from the poem.  In 1901 The Finnish Publishing Co., the publisher of “Siirtolainen,” a newspaper whose name meant “The Immigrant” moved to Kaleva from Brooklyn, New York.  Through the newspaper, its readers across the country, other Finnish immigrants learned of the new settlement at Kaleva.  This brought more Finnish families to this area.  The Finnish Evangelical Lutheran Church became the center of the community.  The new immigrants had a strong faith and believed in worship, hard work and education.  The first public school was built in 1904.  Businesses were established and flourished and three hotels were built.  The presence of a hardworking, god fearing people made a strong community possible.

Today a visit to Kaleva is a place to enjoy nature, outdoor sports, fishing for salmon and hunting.  Nearby is the Manistee National Forest with hiking trails.  In the village there is a roadside park for picnicking and overnight camping is available.  Kaleva’s most well known attraction is the Bottle House Museum, on the National Historic Register, built out of 60,000 bottles by John Makinen.  In 1941, Makinen built this home out of leftover bottles from his pop bottling factory.  In 1980, the Kaleva Historical Society, with community support in fund raising, purchased the home from the Makinen family for a local history museum.  Open on weekends in the former drugstore, the Kaleva Art Gallery offers local artists’ works.  The Depot Railroad Museum featuring a Manistee and Northern Eastern locomotive is open on Saturdays.  On the fourth weekend of August, the Kaleva Heritage Days are celebrated with food, entertainment and a parade.  The Centennial Walkway is a wonderful walking path on what was the railroad tracks.

Kaleva has a wonderful history, and today has many interesting and fascinating activities in which to partake.</groundspeak:long_description>

It is very beautiful, and has some excellent views of the Big Manistee. When I think of geocaching, this is the kind of cache I think of. Something that will take your breath away! The trench has a spring flowing through...very nice! The coords for the cache are written in black marker on a piece of wood wedged in a cedar tree. Be careful along the edge...Have fun and Happy caching! Beautiful!

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Can't believe we took over two years to get around to this fantastic cache! This is a wonderful place! This one practically belongs to the Hosta grrrl. First she decided to slide down to the stage one on her butt. It was funny to watch her in the aisles at Meijers later, teehee, hardyharhar, with the brown behind on her blue jeans. Then on the final stage she took the side of the trench where the container actually was and so found it. Anyone reading this who thinks of just 'following the needle' from stage 1 to the final, don't even think of it. It will NOT be easier than going back up, over, and back down and up. MD, if that info is too much of a tell, feel free to scratch this log and we'll do it over. Good thing we finally did it, we're getting on in years and this one was close to our physical limits, hooray rope ;-) TFTC!

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This is part of our Spirit Series of Manistee County. It is located in a cemetary in Kaleva, hence the name of the cache. This area was settled by Finnish people. Take a look around you at the names on the monuments. This is probably the most orderly cemetary in our series. It was so clean it made hiding a cache difficult!!

If you are in the area at the time of Winter solstice in December, pay a visit to this cemetary and see the luminaria on the graves. A Finnish tradition.

Please remember that Michigan law states that all cemeteries are closed from dusk to dawn.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">This is located near stumps and submerged logs on the river. 
DO NOT try and cross the ice in the winter as this river doesn't freeze soild at anytimes. Very easy with a canoe or kayak.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">    You will need a canoe or a kayak to find this cache. Even though it is located on the beautiful Torch River it is in an area with some stumps and submerged logs.
    
   
    Torch River is a main artery connecting Skegemog Lake and Elk Lake with Torch Lake. During the peak months this river is very busy with boat traffic. There are two nearby
locations where you can launch a boat. One is on Torch Lake where Torch River flows out of it. This is at N44 51.028  W085 19.691 and the other is the boat launch located on
Aarwood Trail at  N44 50.564  W085 19.214  Both are well used boat launches. 
     
   
    If you don’t have a canoe or kayak, you can rent a kayak at N44 51.015  W085 19.635 This waterway has many great areas to explore. I have seen beaver, otter, bald eagles, deer, raccoon and many types of ducks up and down this river.

    
    The cache itself is a small 2x4x4 black box that should be obvious to those who are looking for it. The contents need to be small.
    

    To start with: six assorted types of keychains,
                   two Indian arrow heads,
                   one Sacagawea gold dollar, 
                   a couple of signature cards,
                   a log book.

  Enjoy the area.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;b&gt;This area was dedicated in 1973 by the Department of Natural
Resources as a refuge from today's noisy world. All motorized
vehicles and equipment are prohibited from entering this area. This
area is great to watch wildlife, hike, bike, or cross country ski.
It is comprised of 2,800 acres of state forest land located between
Grand Traverse and Kalkaska Counties. There are marked pathways
through the property although they are not maintained due to recent
cut backs. The restrooms, disposal, and water well have also been
disabled. Please tread lightly and preform CITO when posible. The
challenge consists of 5 standard amo boxes for each of the 5 Sand
Lakes. There is a 6th mystery cache that is hidden near by. To find
the mystery cache you will have to find all the others to get the
codes that are on each of the log books.&lt;/b&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Skegemog Lake Wildlife Area

If you've been to "Heidi the Swamp Dog" cache, you'll be somewhat familiar to this wonderful area. However, that was not the only part of the Skegemog Lake Wildlife Area that exists. There are about 3,300 acres of swamp , forest and uplands that, under the direction of the MDNR, exist for your enjoyment of nature. There are several locations where you can enjoy the beauty of Lake Skegemog, and this location is one that is often overlooked. It's a short walk to the lookout, and on your way in, sign the "guest book," and read what other people wrote. There is an information board which gives you the history of this park. It's very interesting reading. (also, find a doodle of mine of Heidi and Cowboy in the guest book)
Take your camera and binoculars because I guarantee you'll see wildlife in, on, and above the water, enjoy some old-growth trees, and contemplate what this area must have looked like before they installed the dam in Elk Rapids, which flooded this area, leaving the underwater stump field you can see from the platform. This is a beautiful spot, any time of year.

In the theme of "Heidi the Swamp Dog," this is a large ammo box filled with some doggie stuff, but not all.  I have a new English Pointer pup named Sammy's Singin' Cowboy Roy, (Cowboy), and this cache is dedicated to him. There is a very nice FTF prize, so get out there and be the first to find it! 
Cowboy Roy is counting on you! (He was with me when we discovered this hiding spot.)

Happy hunting!
PS: To avoid unnecessary bushwhacking, start looking for the cache AFTER you get to the lookout.</groundspeak:long_description>

I picked Tyler(7) up from school as the doors opened and we climbed into the packed Escape and headed north to God’s country.  We set up out tent and gear 0.3 miles west of this cache.  We figured there was plenty of daylight left so decided to head out for this cache.  I grabbed a shotgun, as we heard some bird hunters shooting while at camp, and Tyler grabbed his BB-gun.  We circled through the woods, as Tyler had the GPS in his hands.   When we arrived at the cache site Tyler quickly recovered the container.  We celebrated with some high five and signed the log.  You selected a nice spot for the cache; thanks for bringing us here.  I dropped a coin I had been carrying for too long.  We then followed the river downstream back to our campsite.  Our old lab Libby enjoyed a long swim in the river to add to the caches memories.  Thanks for a great caching start to wonderful father-son weekend.   </groundspeak:text>

Resources as a refuge from today's noisy world. All motorized
vehicles and equipment are prohibited from entering this area. This
area is great to watch wildlife, hike, bike, or cross country ski.
It is comprised of 2,800 acres of state forest land located between
Grand Traverse and Kalkaska Counties. There are marked pathways
through the property although they are not maintained due to recent
cut backs. The restrooms, disposal, and water well have also been
disabled. Please tread lightly and preform CITO when posible. For
the final you must use ALL the clues you have found and solve some
simple addition and subtraction.&lt;/b&gt;

Didn't have to cross the creek. Must have two-tracked in from the other side.
Even tho the caching results for the day were disapointing we had a great time in this beautiful scenic area.

There were two general stores, R.F.Danville(lumberman and horse dealer),grain elevator, realestate office and blacksmith shop.

It was named Marilla because that was the name of the daughter of the man who donated land for the school and township offices. 

It was located on the Manistee and Northeastern Railroad.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;b&gt;This area was dedicated in 1973 by the Department of Natural
Resources as a refuge from today's noisy world. All motorized
vehicles and equipment are prohibited from entering this area. This
area is great to watch wildlife, hike, bike, or cross country ski.
It is comprised of 2,800 acres of state forest land located between
Grand Traverse and Kalkaska Counties. There are marked pathways
through the property although they are not maintained due to recent
cut backs. The restrooms, disposal, and water well have also been
disabled. Please tread lightly and preform CITO when posible. The
challenge consists of 5 standard amo boxes for each of the 5 Sand
Lakes. There is a 6th mystery cache that is hidden near by. To find
the mystery cache you will have to find all the others to get the
codes that are on each of the log books.&lt;/b&gt;

What a great walk along this scenic footpath with the sounds of rushing water and the beautiful colors combining to make this a real treat this morning.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">We spent the morning assembly and raising a ladder treestand for rifle season on a spot only about a mile away.  My dad, brothers, and uncles were all up in this area for the weekend quad riding.  Tyler(7) and I grilled manly burgers, baked beans, and mashed potatoes at our camp-site on the Boardman River for our family members before enjoying an afternoon of caching.  This was our 4th find for Saturday afternoon.  We made this casual walk on a pleasant fall day to the cache site where Tyler eventually discovered this container.  We sat along the river bank and rested as we signed the log.  Tyler returned it to its hiding spot at this scenic destination as I headed back to the trail.  About 50 yards later was happy to retreat back to the river bank to retrieve the gps dad had left behind.  Thanks for the scenic hide.  Thanks for being a part of a great caching afternoon, during a wonderful father-son weekend. </groundspeak:text>

Take the sum of the digits and multiply that by .001, the result will be "the number". The longitude of the cache be found by adding "the number' to 19.656 minutes and the latitude can be ascertained by subtracting "the number"&amp;nbsp; from 51.059 minutes. The cache is a large size pill bottle covered with camo tape and vegetation so bring small items to trade. (Child proof, press and twist) You can drive to within a few feet of both stops. The cache site gets high usage so please practice stealth when retrieving the container and care when returning it to its concealed location.

The muggle factor was very high at stage two today, but in between them I managed to find this well hidden cache and sign the log without any notice from any muggles.  While waiting the muggles out,  I thoroughly enjoyed watching a large brown trout chase suckers from under the bridge in the river and the great view of the lake.  No pic of me with Rocky and Porky, I took one but did not turn out.  I never can take a good pic of myself, can't see what I'm doing.  TNLNSL, TFTC and FUN!

&lt;br&gt;
"A cool summer in early June, is when the legend began, at a
nameless logging camp in Wexford County, where the Manistee River
ran..eleven lumberjacks near the Garland swamp found an animal they
thought was a dog..in a playful mood they chased it around till it

and poked around inside..then the thing let out an unearthly scream
and came out……and stood..upright….None of those men ever said very

belongings and left that night, were never heard from again..."&lt;br&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This is a cache where one should do a lot of mapping research, and even after that we had to detour twice because wind blown down'd trees, and (who did this) tree piles blocked our travels to find this. Anyway, it was worth the 2-tracker adventures, and the interesting story about the local bIgFooT legend, especially after the DNR's admission that there may indeed be cougar in the northern lower penninsula of MI and mebbe even some 'wolverine', not to mention wolves.

Gotta love the fact that northern MI is so wild, so don't whine about wet boots and the skeeters, eh?

Now we wish MD would confirm his cache back in this area, as we've been planning to do these for so long as an outing, but having seen the past few logs on 'the trench' we'll wait for him or someone to confirm it's still live...

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This cache is a memorial to Ada Marie McDowell who passed away July 28th, 2003.  Ada often came to this beach to collect rocks for their rock shop which was located a mile south from here on highway M-31.  The rock shop no longer exists but was well known by area residents during the 1970's and 1980's.  Ada would occasionally bring her children, grand-children, and great-grandchildren to this beach to show them rocks to pick. After Ada passed away, and to this very day, her descendants continue to stop by here on their way to visit her gravesite.  This locale has become known to them as "Grandma's Beach".  This beach is abundant in the most popular Michigan stones, our state stone, the "Petoskey".  We have placed in this cache a few of them so that you will know what they look like.  Try your hand at finding a few Petoskey stones, and place one of them inside the cache.  Or if you are not able to find one, take one from the cache and replace it with any other beautiful stone.  Of course, if the weather is inclement, feel free to place any item of your choice in the petoskey's place instead.  The original cache holds 15 Petoskey Stones, as well as 15 Coral Fossil Stones which are also abundant on this beach.  There is a special first finder treat inside also.  Good Luck...Ken and Carol of team "geoJockey"

__________________________________________________________
___________________The Petoskey Stone_____________________
  The Petoskey Stone is most unique in its composition and
  origin.  It is composed of the fossilized skeletons of
  colony coral (hexagonaria) who lived their life span in
  the warm sea waters that covered Michigan during the
  Devonian Period some 350 million years ago.  Each small
  hexagonal chamber of this unique stone is a section
  containing the prehistoric remains of a salt-water marine
  life.  The Petoskey Stone is found only in the northern
  part of the lower peninsula of Michigan.

After a more careful review it was decided to hunt 2 other nearby caches first and save this one for last.  There was another person here taking advantage of the nice day to get some trout fishing in on the last day of the season, and so wasn’t interested in, or in the way of, our search.

My dad, brothers, and uncles were all up in this area for the weekend quad riding.  Tyler(7) and I grilled manly burgers, baked beans, and mashed potatoes at our camp-site on the Boardman River for our family members before enjoying an afternoon of caching.  This was our 3rd find for Saturday afternoon.  We made this casual walk on a pleasant fall day to the cache site where Tyler eventually uncovered this container.  We signed the log and returned it to its hiding spot at this scenic destination.  Since this was a little longer walk I had carried my 20ga. and Tyler his BB gun.  We took a loop a little farther upstream where Tyler nearly stumbled over a ruffled grouse.  This was his first introduction to the species.  I lead him a little closer to the river to the river near a patch of pine trees where I too kicked up and missed a grouse.  We laughed and he clamored about how fast the birds were.  We circled pack towards the road without disturbing the peace of the tranquil woods anymore.  Thanks for the scenic hide.  Thanks for being a part of a great caching afternoon, and helping to forge great memories during a wonderful father-son weekend.   </groundspeak:text>

Resources as a refuge from today's noisy world. All motorized
vehicles and equipment are prohibited from entering this area. This
area is great to watch wildlife, hike, bike, or cross country ski.
It is comprised of 2,800 acres of state forest land located between
Grand Traverse and Kalkaska Counties. There are marked pathways
through the property although they are not maintained due to recent
cut backs. The restrooms, disposal, and water well have also been
disabled. Please tread lightly and preform CITO when posible. The
challenge consists of 5 standard amo boxes for each of the 5 Sand
Lakes. There is a 6th mystery cache that is hidden near by. To find
the mystery cache you will have to find all the others to get the
codes that are on each of the log books.&lt;/b&gt;

Great caches, in some parts of Sand Lakes we'd not hiked back to before. Signed the log, and headed off for SCL #1, with limited daylight and a long walk back to Broomhead Road to look forward to. Thanks for bringing us here.

As you look around, imagine what this community might have looked like in the early 1900's. Those pioneers were a rugged bunch! Don't think I would have survived.</groundspeak:long_description>

that even our old buddy, Murphy, could really do anything to make
this go wrong! Besides, he's just next door, kinda watching over
this cache (metaphorically speaking). The cache itself is a coffee
cup sized plastic container and appropriately cammo'd. It has the
usual stash note and log book with writing implements. Please do
watch for muggles, and also take your time to wind your way through
this small cemetary, you never who you'll meet!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;b&gt;The Sand Lake Challenge has begun! The challenge will take you
to the Sand Lake Quiet area.&lt;/b&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;b&gt;This area was dedicated in 1973 by the Department of Natural
Resources as a refuge from today's noisy world. All motorized
vehicles and equipment are prohibited from entering this area. This
area is great to watch wildlife, hike, bike, or cross country ski.
It is comprised of 2,800 acres of state forest land located between
Grand Traverse and Kalkaska Counties. There are marked pathways
through the property although they are not maintained due to recent
cut backs. The restrooms, disposal, and water well have also been
disabled. Please tread lightly and preform CITO when posible. The
challenge consists of 5 standard amo boxes for each of the 5 Sand
Lakes. There is a 6th mystery cache that is hidden near by. To find
the mystery cache you will have to find all the others to get the
codes that are on each of the log books.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;As always have fun in nature! &lt;!-- Begin NMG Code --&gt;

Come in from the road and follow the river for a more difficult (but interesting) trip. Or just follow the trail (used to be rail road tracks). Either way its still a bit annoying to find. I recomend searching in dryer weather. and be carefull, some of the terrain is rather steep.</groundspeak:long_description>

The fact that we were unable to locate the cache made this all the more frustrating.  Very steep and overgrown with brush.  Went down the hill to the fence covering stream.  Still no luck.  </groundspeak:text>

However, I don't know how quickly we would have spotted it if he hadn't scrambled up the other side like a goat!  We also left our pen in the cache.  I'm not sure how much ink it has left in it, but I figured the next cacher would want to make a trip back to their vehicle for a writing tool!  TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

P.S. - a hint if your going shortly after this post, just look for the plant life wilted by profanity. </groundspeak:text>
