This will be the first in a series of "No Parking Hides on the UM campus.
We are surely not responsible for any parking tickets you receive while on these hunts. (actually if you think about it this is a good reason to have the difficulty up at 4 or so) 

No room for trackables.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I asked PTH if he wanted to go and do some caching.  It was his first time and he didn't know what to expect or what to look for.  This was a great cache for him to cut his teeth on.  First time I saw a cache like this.  nice!  PTH mentioned you might want to be careful of wasps in the summer, there were quite a few nests around the area.  TFTC.</groundspeak:text>
